  <description>The 1989 Ironman® World Championship was the greatest race ever. In a spectacular duel that become known as the Iron War, the world's two strongest athletes raced side by side at world-record pace for a grueling 139 miles. Driven by one of the fiercest rivalries in triathlon, Dave Scott and Mark Allen raced shoulder to shoulder through the Ironman 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike race, and 26.2-mile marathon. After 8 punishing hours, both men would demolish the previous record—and cross the finish line just 58 seconds apart. The race would redefine the limits of human endurance and the role of mental toughness in sports. In his new book Iron War, sports journalist Matt Fitzgerald writes a riveting epic about how Allen and Scott drove themselves and each other through the most awe-inspiring race in sports history. Iron War goes beyond the pulse-pounding race story to offer a fascinating exploration of the lives of the world's two toughest men and their unquenchable desire to succeed. Weaving an examination of mental resolve into a gripping tale of athletic adventure, Iron War is a soaring narrative of two champions and the paths that led to their stunning final showdown. </description>

  <description>In his #1 bestselling books &lt;i&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Blink&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Outliers&lt;/i&gt;, Malcolm Gladwell has explored the ways we understand and change our world. Now he looks at the complex and surprising ways the weak can defeat the strong, the small can match up against the giant, and how our goals (often culturally determined) can make a huge difference in our ultimate sense of success. Drawing upon examples from the world of business, sports, culture, cutting-edge psychology, and an array of unforgettable characters around the world, &lt;i&gt;David and Goliath&lt;/i&gt; is in many ways the most practical and provocative book Malcolm Gladwell has ever written.</description>

  <description>In the wake of his retirement from professional basketball, Kobe “The Black Mamba” Bryant has decided to share his vast knowledge and understanding of the game to take readers on an unprecedented journey to the core of the legendary “Mamba mentality.” Citing an obligation and an opportunity to teach young players, hardcore fans, and devoted students of the game how to play it “the right way,” &lt;i&gt;The Mamba Mentalit&lt;/i&gt;y takes us inside the mind of one of the most intelligent, analytical, and creative basketball players ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, and in his own words, Bryant reveals his famously detailed approach and the steps he took to prepare mentally and physically to not just succeed at the game, but to excel. Readers will learn how Bryant studied an opponent, how he channeled his passion for the game, how he played through injuries. They’ll also get fascinating granular detail as he breaks down specific plays and match-ups from throughout his career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bryant’s detailed accounts are paired with stunning photographs by the Hall of Fame photographer Andrew D. Bernstein. Bernstein, long the Lakers and NBA official photographer, captured Bryant’s very first NBA photo in 1996 and his last in 2016—and hundreds of thousands in between, the record of a unique, twenty-year relationship between one athlete and one photographer.</description>

  <description>Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills — and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit — he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>As it was in Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, and Othello, so it is in life. Most forms of private vice and public evil are kindled and sustained by lies. Acts of adultery and other personal betrayals, financial fraud, government corruption—even murder and genocide—generally require an additional moral defect: a willingness to lie.</description>

  <description>Do you feel awkward at networking events? Do you wonder what your date really thinks of you? Do you wish you could decode people? You need to learn the science of people.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a human behavior hacker, Vanessa Van Edwards created a research lab to study the hidden forces that drive us. And she’s cracked the code. In Captivate, she shares shortcuts, systems, and secrets for taking charge of your interactions at work, at home, and in any social situation. These aren’t the people skills you learned in school. This is the first comprehensive, science backed, real life manual on how to captivate anyone—and a completely new approach to building connections.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just like knowing the formulas to use in a chemistry lab, or the right programming language to build an app, Captivate provides simple ways to solve people problems. You’ll learn, for example…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;· How to work a room: Every party, networking event, and social situation has a predictable map. Discover the sweet spot for making the most connections.&lt;br /&gt;· How to read faces: It’s easier than you think to speed-read facial expressions and use them to predict people’s emotions.&lt;br /&gt;· How to talk to anyone: Every conversation can be memorable—once you learn how certain words generate the pleasure hormone dopamine in listeners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you understand the laws of human behavior, your influence, impact, and income will increase significantly. What’s more, you will improve your interpersonal intelligence, make a killer first impression, and build rapport quickly and authentically in any situation—negotiations, interviews, parties, and pitches. You’ll never interact the same way again.</description>

  <description>He's just escaped from one of the world's most brutal regimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, he decides to tunnel back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's summer, 1962, and Joachim Rudolph, a student, is digging a tunnel under the Berlin Wall. Waiting on the other side in East Berlin - dozens of men, women and children; all willing to risk everything to escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the award-winning creator of the acclaimed BBC Radio 4 podcast, Tunnel 29 is the true story of the most remarkable escape tunnel dug under the Berlin Wall. Drawing on hundreds of hours of interviews with the survivors, and thousands of pages of Stasi documents, Helena Merriman brilliantly reveals the stranger-than-fiction story of the ingenious group of student-diggers, the glamorous red-haired messenger, the American News network which films the escape, and the Stasi spy who betrays it. For what Joachim doesn't know as he burrows closer to East Germany, is that the escape operation has been infiltrated. As the escapees prepare to crawl through the cold, wet darkness, above them, the Stasi are closing in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tunnel 29 is about what happens when people lose their freedom - and how some will do anything to win it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acclaim for the TUNNEL 29 podcast:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Combining the fun of a thriller that we know will end happily with grim perspective on history and tyranny... stunning' New Yorker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Reminiscent of a savvy Netflix block buster series' Evening Standard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'A truly exciting yarn... creates a sense for the listener of being right there in the tunnel, experiencing the dangers.'

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A transformative, fascinating theory--based on robust and groundbreaking experimental research--reveals how our unconscious fear of death powers almost everything we do, shining a light on the hidden motives that drive human behavior&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than one hundred years ago, the American philosopher William James dubbed the knowledge that we must die “the worm at the core” of the human condition. In 1974, cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker won the Pulitzer Prize for his book &lt;i&gt;The Denial of Death,&lt;/i&gt; arguing that the terror of death has a pervasive effect on human affairs. Now authors Sheldon Solomon, Jeff Greenberg, and Tom Pyszczynski clarify with wide-ranging evidence the many ways the worm at the core guides our thoughts and actions, from the great art we create to the devastating wars we wage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Worm at the Core&lt;/i&gt; is the product of twenty-five years of in-depth research. Drawing from innovative experiments conducted around the globe, Solomon, Greenberg, and Pyszczynski show conclusively that the fear of death and the desire to transcend it inspire us to buy expensive cars, crave fame, put our health at risk, and disguise our animal nature. The fear of death can also prompt judges to dole out harsher punishments, make children react negatively to people different from themselves, and inflame intolerance and violence.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But the worm at the core need not consume us. Emerging from their research is a unique and compelling approach to these deeply existential issues: terror management theory. TMT proposes that human culture infuses our lives with order, stability, significance, and purpose, and these anchors enable us to function moment to moment without becoming overwhelmed by the knowledge of our ultimate fate.</description>

  <description>Bestselling author and award-winning adventurer Ross Edgley has been studying the art of resilience for years, applying all he has learned to become the first person in history to swim around Great Britain, breaking multiple world records. Now Ross focuses on mental strength, stoicism and the training needed to create an unbreakable body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross Edgley famously ran a marathon pulling a 1.4-tonne car and climbed a rope the height of Everest (8,848m), after living with Yamabushi warrior monks in Japan and partaking in Shamanic pain rituals with fire ants in the Amazon jungle. On his epic 1,780-mile journey around Great Britain, which lasted 157 days, Ross swam through giant jellyfish, arctic storms, ‘haunted’ whirlpools and polluted shipping lanes, going so hard, and so fast, his tongue fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross’s previous book, The World’s Fittest Book, was a Sunday Times No.1 bestseller and explored the science of physical fitness. Now, in The Art of Resilience, Ross uses his swim experience and other amazing endurance feats, where he managed to overcome seemingly insurmountable pain, hardship and adversity, to study the performance of extreme athletes, military and fitness specialists and psychologists to uncover the secrets of mental fitness and explore the concept of resilience, persistence, valour and a disciplined mindset in overcoming adversity. This ground-breaking book represents a paradigm shift in what we thought the human body and mind were capable of and will give you a blueprint to become a tougher, more resilient and ultimately better human – whatever the challenge you face.</description>

  <description>From its beginnings in the 1920s until its demise in the 1980s, Bell Labs—officially, the research and development wing of AT&amp;amp;T—was the biggest, and arguably the best, laboratory for new ideas in the world. From the transistor to the laser, it’s hard to find an aspect of modern life that hasn’t been touched by Bell Labs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did so many transformative ideas come from Bell Labs? In The Idea Factory, Jon Gertner traces the origins of some of the twentieth century’s most important inventions and delivers a riveting and heretofore untold chapter of American history. At its heart this is a story about the life and work of a small group of brilliant and eccentric men—Mervin Kelly, Bill Shockley, Claude Shannon, John Pierce, and Bill Baker—who spent their careers at Bell Labs. Their job was to research and develop the future of communications. Small-town boys, childhood hobbyists, oddballs: they give the lie to the idea that Bell Labs was a grim cathedral of top-down command and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gertner brings to life the powerful alchemy of the forces at work behind Bell Labs inventions, teasing out the intersections between science, business, and society. He distills the lessons that abide: how to recruit and nurture young talent; how to organize and lead fractious employees; how to find solutions to the most stubbornly vexing problems; how to transform a scientific discovery into a marketable product, then make it even better, cheaper, or both. Today, when the drive to invent has become a mantra, Bell Labs offers us a way to enrich our understanding of the challenges and solutions to technological innovation. Here, after all, was where the foundational ideas on the management of innovation were born.&lt;br /&gt;The Idea Factory is the story of the origins of modern communications and the beginnings of the information age—a deeply human story of extraordinary men who were given extraordinary means—time, space, funds, and access to one another—and edged the world into a new dimension.</description>

  <description>After Englishman John Blackthorne is lost at sea, he awakens in a place few Europeans know of and even fewer have seen--Nippon. Thrust into the closed society that is seventeenth-century Japan, a land where the line between life and death is razor-thin, Blackthorne must negotiate not only a foreign people, with unknown customs and language, but also his own definitions of morality, truth, and freedom. As internal political strife and a clash of cultures lead to seemingly inevitable conflict, Blackthorne's loyalty and strength of character are tested by both passion and loss, and he is torn between two worlds that will each be forever changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powerful and engrossing, capturing both the rich pageantry and stark realities of life in feudal Japan, &lt;i&gt;Sh&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;ō&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;gun&lt;/i&gt; is a critically acclaimed powerhouse of a book. Heart-stopping, edge-of-your-seat action melds seamlessly with intricate historical detail and raw human emotion. Endlessly compelling, this sweeping saga captivated the world to become not only one of the best-selling novels of all time but also one of the highest-rated television miniseries, as well as inspiring a nationwide surge of interest in the culture of Japan. Shakespearean in both scope and depth, &lt;i&gt;Sh&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;ō&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;gun&lt;/i&gt; is, as the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; put it, "...not only something you read--you live it." Provocative, absorbing, and endlessly fascinating, there is only one: &lt;i&gt;Sh&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;ō&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;gun.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In the words of economist and scholar Arnold Kling, Martin Gurri saw it coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technology has categorically reversed the information balance of power between the public and the elites who manage the great hierarchical institutions of the industrial age government, political parties, the media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revolt of the Public tells the story of how insurgencies, enabled by digital devices and a vast information sphere, have mobilized millions of ordinary people around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally published in 2014, this updated edition of The Revolt of the Public includes an extensive analysis of Donald Trump's improbable rise to the presidency and the electoral triumphs of Brexit and concludes with a speculative look forward, pondering whether the current elite class can bring about a reformation of the democratic process and whether new organizing principles, adapted to a digital world, can arise out of the present political turbulence.</description>

  <description>The Second World War began in August 1939 on the edge of Manchuria and ended there exactly six years later with the Soviet invasion of northern China. The war in Europe appeared completely divorced from the war in the Pacific and China, and yet events on opposite sides of the world had profound effects. Using the most up-to-date scholarship and research, and writing with clarity and compassion, Beevor assembles the whole picture in a gripping narrative that extends from the North Atlantic to the South Pacific, from the snowbound steppe to the North African Desert, to the Burmese jungle, SS Einsatzgruppen in the borderlands, Gulag prisoners drafted into punishment battalions, and to the unspeakable cruelties of the Sino-Japanese War. Moral choice forms the basis of all human drama, and no other period in history has presented greater dilemmas both for leaders and ordinary people, nor offered such examples of individual and mass tragedy, the corruption of power politics, ideological hypocrisy, the egomania of commanders, betrayal, perversity, self-sacrifice, unbelievable sadism and unpredictable kindness. Although filling the broadest canvas on a heroic scale, Beevor's THE SECOND WORLD WAR never loses sight of the fate of the ordinary soldiers and civilians whose lives were crushed by the titanic forces unleashed in this, the most terrible war in history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” — Marcus Aurelius&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are stuck, stymied, frustrated. But it needn’t be this way. There is a formula for success that’s been followed by the icons of history—from John D. Rockefeller to Amelia Earhart to Ulysses S. Grant to Steve Jobs—a formula that let them turn obstacles into opportunities. Faced with impossible situations, they found the astounding triumphs we all seek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These men and women were not exceptionally brilliant, lucky, or gifted. Their success came from timeless philosophical principles laid down by a Roman emperor who struggled to articulate a method for excellence in any and all situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book reveals that formula for the first time—and shows us how we can turn our own adversity into advantage.</description>

  <description>From award-winning actor and food obsessive Stanley Tucci comes an intimate and charming memoir of life in and out of the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Stanley Tucci became a household name with &lt;i&gt;The Devil Wears Prada, The Hunger Games, &lt;/i&gt;and the perfect Negroni, he grew up in an Italian American family that spent every night around the table. He shared the magic of those meals with us in &lt;i&gt;The Tucci Cookbook &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Tucci Table&lt;/i&gt;, and now he takes us beyond the recipes and into the stories behind them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Taste &lt;/i&gt;is a reflection on the intersection of food and life, filled with anecdotes about growing up in Westchester, New York, preparing for and filming the foodie films &lt;i&gt;Big Night &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Julie &amp;amp; Julia&lt;/i&gt;, falling in love over dinner, and teaming up with his wife to create conversation-starting meals for their children. Each morsel of this gastronomic journey through good times and bad, five-star meals and burnt dishes, is as heartfelt and delicious as the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written with Stanley's signature wry humour and nostalgia, &lt;i&gt;Taste &lt;/i&gt;is a heartwarming read that will be irresistible for anyone who knows the power of a home-cooked meal.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>You can follow the beaten path and call yourself an entrepreneur or you can blaze your own trail and really be one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Derek Sivers started CD Baby, he wasn’t planning on building a major business. He was a successful independent musician who just wanted to sell his CDs online. When no one would help him do it, he set out on his own and built an online store from scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He started in 1998 by helping his friends sell their CDs. In 2000, he hired his first employee. Eight years later, he sold CD Baby for $22 million.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sivers didn’t need a business plan, and neither do you. You don’t need to think big; in fact, it’s better if you don’t. Start with what you have, care about your customers more than yourself, and run your business like you don’t need the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;©2011 Derek Sivers (P)2011 Brilliance Audio, Inc.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not quite non-fiction, not quite self-help. It’s a work of art about conflicting philosophies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many books believe they know how you should live.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But each book disagrees with the next.&lt;br /&gt;In “How to Live”, each chapter believes it knows how you should live.&lt;br /&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;each chapter disagrees with the next&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One chapter makes a compelling argument for why you should be completely independent, keeping all options open. The next chapter argues why you should commit to one career, one place, and one person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One chapter persuades you to be fully present, and experience each moment. The next, to delay gratification and invest for the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one is right? Which does the author believe? All of them. It's &lt;strong&gt;a philosophy of conflicting philosophies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very unique and thought-provoking book.&lt;br /&gt;Meant for reflection as much as instruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;113 incredibly succinct pages of profound insights.&lt;br /&gt;No philosophers are quoted.&lt;br /&gt;No -isms are named.&lt;br /&gt;Only &lt;strong&gt;actionable directives&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;The end result feels more like poetry than prose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>One of the most acclaimed books of our time, winner of both the Pulitzer and the Francis Parkman prizes, &lt;b&gt;The Power Broker&lt;/b&gt; tells the hidden story behind the shaping (and mis-shaping) of twentieth-century New York (city and state) and makes public what few have known: that Robert Moses was, for almost half a century, the single most powerful man of our time in New York, the shaper not only of the city's politics but of its physical structure and the problems of urban decline that plague us today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In revealing how Moses did it--how he developed his public authorities into a political machine that was virtually a fourth branch of government, one that could bring to their knees Governors and Mayors (from La Guardia to Lindsay) by mobilizing banks, contractors, labor unions, insurance firms, even the press and the Church, into an irresistible economic force--Robert Caro reveals how power works in all the cities of the United States. Moses built an empire and lived like an emperor. He personally conceived and completed public works costing 27 billion dollars--the greatest builder America (and probably the world) has ever known. Without ever having been elected to office, he dominated the men who were--even his most bitter enemy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, could not control him--until he finally encountered, in Nelson Rockefeller, the only man whose power (and ruthlessness in wielding it) equalled his own.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How can we apply the teachings of the greatest ancient philosopher to modern life?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Socrates is the quintessential Athenian philosopher, the source of the entire Western philosophical tradition, and Godfather to the Stoics. He spent his life teaching practical philosophy to ordinary people in the streets of Athens, yet few people today are familiar with the wisdom he has to offer us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to Think Like Socrates is an accessible and informative guide to the life of one of the greatest thinkers in history, and the first book to focus on applying his ideas to our daily lives. Author Donald J. Robertson transports readers back to ancient Athens, expertly weaving together a page-turning account of a philosopher who eschewed material pleasures and stood by his beliefs, even in the face of controversy, with a steadfastness that ultimately resulted in his execution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to Think Like Socrates highlights the continuing value of the Socratic Method to modern life. As a practicing cognitive-behavioral psychotherapist, Robertson also uses his expertise to reveal many parallels between the evidence-based concepts and techniques of modern psychology and the philosophy of Socrates and shows how his philosophical insights can guide and benefit all of us to this day.</description>

  <description>It’s 1944 and sixteen-year-old ballerina and gymnast Edith Eger is sent to Auschwitz. Separated from her parents on arrival, she endures unimaginable experiences, including being made to dance for the infamous Josef Mengele. When the camp is finally liberated, she is pulled from a pile of bodies, barely alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The horrors of the Holocaust didn’t break Edith. In fact, they helped her learn to live again with a life-affirming strength and a truly remarkable resilience. &lt;i&gt;The Choice&lt;/i&gt; is her unforgettable story.</description>

  <description>From the development of the U-2 to the Stealth fighter, the never-before-told story behind the high-stakes quest to dominate the skies Skunk Works is the true story of America's most secret &amp;amp; successful aerospace operation. As recounted by Ben Rich, the operation's brilliant boss for nearly two decades, the chronicle of Lockheed's legendary Skunk Works is a drama of cold war confrontations and Gulf War air combat, of extraordinary feats of engineering &amp;amp; achievement against fantastic odds. Here are up-close portraits of the maverick band of scientists &amp;amp; engineers who made the Skunk Works so renowned. Filled with telling personal anecdotes &amp;amp; high adventure, with narratives from the CIA &amp;amp; from Air Force pilots who flew the many classified, risky missions, this book is a portrait of the most spectacular aviation triumphs of the 20th century.</description>

  <description>Darrow would have lived in peace, but his enemies brought him war. The Gold overlords demanded his obedience, hanged his wife, and enslaved his people. But Darrow is determined to fight back. Risking everything to transform himself and breach Gold society, Darrow has battled to survive the cutthroat rivalries that breed Society’s mightiest warriors, climbed the ranks, and waited patiently to unleash the revolution that will tear the hierarchy apart from within.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, the time has come.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But devotion to honor and hunger for vengeance run deep on both sides. Darrow and his comrades-in-arms face powerful enemies without scruple or mercy. Among them are some Darrow once considered friends. To win, Darrow will need to inspire those shackled in darkness to break their chains, unmake the world their cruel masters have built, and claim a destiny too long denied—and too glorious to surrender.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How will Artificial Intelligence affect crime, war, justice, jobs, society and our very sense of being human? The rise of AI has the potential to transform our future more than any other technology--and there's nobody better qualified or situated to explore that future than Max Tegmark, an MIT professor who's helped mainstream research on how to keep AI beneficial.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can we grow our prosperity through automation without leaving people lacking income or purpose? What career advice should we give today's kids? How can we make future AI systems more robust, so that they do what we want without crashing, malfunctioning or getting hacked? Should we fear an arms race in lethal autonomous weapons? Will machines eventually outsmart us at all tasks, replacing humans on the job market and perhaps altogether? Will AI help life flourish like never before or give us more power than we can handle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What sort of future do &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; want? This book empowers you to join what may be the most important conversation of our time. It doesn't shy away from the full range of viewpoints or from the most controversial issues--from superintelligence to meaning, consciousness and the ultimate physical limits on life in the cosmos.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A manifesto to change how you eat and how you think about the human body.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not you, it’s the food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have entered a new age of eating. For the first time in human history, most of our calories come from an entirely novel set of substances called Ultra-Processed Food. There’s a long, formal scientific definition, but it can be boiled down to this: if it’s wrapped in plastic and has at least one ingredient that you wouldn’t find in your kitchen, it’s UPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are specifically engineered to behave as addictive substances, driving excess consumption. They are now linked to the leading cause of early death globally and the number one cause of environmental destruction. Yet almost all our staple foods are ultra-processed. UPF &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; our food culture and for many people it is the only available and affordable food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, Chris van Tulleken, father, scientist, doctor, and award-winning BBC broadcaster, marshals the latest evidence to show how governments, scientists, and doctors have allowed transnational food companies to create a pandemic of diet-related disease. The solutions don’t lie in willpower, personal responsibility, or exercise. You’ll find no diet plan in this book―but join Chris as he undertakes a powerful self-experiment that made headlines around the world: under the supervision of colleagues at University College London he spent a month eating a diet of 80 percent UPF, typical for many children and adults in the United States. While his body became the subject of scientific scrutiny, he spoke to the world’s leading experts from academia, agriculture, and―most important―the food industry itself. But more than teaching him about the experience of the food, the diet switched off Chris’s own addiction to UPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a fast-paced and eye-opening narrative he explores the origins, science, and economics of UPF to reveal its catastrophic impact on our bodies and the planet. And he proposes real solutions for doctors, for policy makers, and for all of us who have to eat. A book that won’t only upend the way you shop and eat, &lt;i&gt;Ultra-Processed People&lt;/i&gt; will open your eyes to the need for action on a global scale.</description>

  <description>As a Red, Darrow grew up working the mines deep beneath the surface of Mars, enduring backbreaking labor while dreaming of the better future he was building for his descendants. But the Society he faithfully served was built on lies. Darrow’s kind have been betrayed and denied by their elitist masters, the Golds—and their only path to liberation is revolution. And so Darrow sacrifices himself in the name of the greater good for which Eo, his true love and inspiration, laid down her own life. He becomes a Gold, infiltrating their privileged realm so that he can destroy it from within. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lamb among wolves in a cruel world, Darrow finds friendship, respect, and even love—but also the wrath of powerful rivals. To wage and win the war that will change humankind’s destiny, Darrow must confront the treachery arrayed against him, overcome his all-too-human desire for retribution—and strive not for violent revolt but a hopeful rebirth. Though the road ahead is fraught with danger and deceit, Darrow must choose to follow Eo’s principles of love and justice to free his people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He must live for more.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"I live for the dream that my children will be born free," she says. "That they will be what they like. That they will own the land their father gave them."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I live for you," I say sadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eo kisses my cheek. "Then you must live for more."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darrow is a Red, a member of the lowest caste in the color-coded society of the future. Like his fellow Reds, he works all day, believing that he and his people are making the surface of Mars livable for future generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet he spends his life willingly, knowing that his blood and sweat will one day result in a better world for his children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Darrow and his kind have been betrayed. Soon he discovers that humanity already reached the surface generations ago. Vast cities and sprawling parks spread across the planet. Darrow—and Reds like him—are nothing more than slaves to a decadent ruling class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by a longing for justice, and driven by the memory of lost love, Darrow sacrifices everything to infiltrate the legendary Institute, a proving ground for the dominant Gold caste, where the next generation of humanity's overlords struggle for power. He will be forced to compete for his life and the very future of civilization against the best and most brutal of Society's ruling class. There, he will stop at nothing to bring down his enemies... even if it means he has to become one of them to do so.</description>

  <description>The heart of Anthony de Mello's bestselling spiritual message is awareness. Mixing Christian spirituality, Buddhist parables, Hindu breathing exercises, and psychological insight, de Mello's words of hope come together in &lt;i&gt;Awareness&lt;/i&gt; in a grand synthesis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short chapters for reading in quiet moments at home or at the office, he cajoles and challenges: We must leave this go-go-go world of illusion and become aware. And this only happens, he insists, by becoming alive to the needs and potential of others, whether at home or in the workplace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, then, is a masterful book of the spirit, challenging us to wake up in every aspect of our lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the National Magazine Award-winning &lt;i&gt;Runner’s World&lt;/i&gt; columnist, frequent &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; online contributor, and Cambridge-trained physicist: a fascinating and definitive exploration of the extraordinary science of human endurance and the secrets of human performance, for fans of &lt;i&gt;The Sports Gene&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Born to Run&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Grit&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From running a two-hour marathon to summiting Mount Everest, we’re fascinated by the extremes of human endurance, constantly testing both our physical and psychological limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How high or far or fast can humans go? And what about individual potential: what defines a person’s limits?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, physiology determined the answer: heart size, lung capacity, and muscle strength. But over the past decade, a wave of dramatic findings in the cutting-edge science of endurance has completely overturned our understanding of human limitation. &lt;i&gt;Endure&lt;/i&gt; widely disseminates these findings for the first time: It’s the brain that dictates how far we can go—which means we can always push ourselves further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hutchinson presents an overview of science’s search for understanding human fatigue, from crude experiments with electricity and frogs’ legs to sophisticated brain imaging technology. Going beyond the traditional mechanical view of human limits (like a car with a brick on its gas pedal, we go until the tank runs out of gas), he instead argues that a key element in endurance is how the brain responds to distress signals—whether heat, or cold, or muscles screaming with lactic acid—and reveals that we can train to improve brain response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An elite distance runner himself, Hutchinson takes us to the forefront of the new sports psychology—brain electrode jolts, computer-based training, subliminal messaging—and presents startling new discoveries enhancing the performance of athletes today and shows how anyone can utilize these tactics to bolster their own performance—and get the most out of their bodies.</description>

  <description>"With its huge, scarred head halfway out of the water and its tail beating the ocean into a white-water wake more than forty feet across, the whale approached the ship at twice its original speed - at least six knots. With a tremendous cracking and splintering of oak, it struck the ship just beneath the anchor secured at the cat-head on the port bow..." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the Heart of the Sea&lt;/i&gt; brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship Essex - an event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours, and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick. In a harrowing page-turner, Nathaniel Philbrick restores this epic story to its rightful place in American history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1820, the 240-ton Essex set sail from Nantucket on a routine voyage for whales. Fifteen months later, in the farthest reaches of the South Pacific, it was repeatedly rammed and sunk by an eighty-ton bull sperm whale. Its twenty-man crew, fearing cannibals on the islands to the west, made for the 3,000-mile-distant coast of South America in three tiny boats. During ninety days at sea under horrendous conditions, the survivors clung to life as one by one, they succumbed to hunger, thirst, disease, and fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philbrick interweaves his account of this extraordinary ordeal of ordinary men with a wealth of whale lore and with a brilliantly detailed portrait of the lost, unique community of Nantucket whalers. Impeccably researched and beautifully told, the book delivers the ultimate portrait of man against nature, drawing on a remarkable range of archival and modern sources, including a long-lost account by the ship's cabin boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once a literary companion and a page-turner that speaks to the same issues of class, race, and man's relationship to nature that permeate the works of Melville, &lt;i&gt;In the Heart of the Sea&lt;/i&gt; will endure as a vital work of American history.</description>

  <description>From Morgan Housel, bestselling author of The Psychology of Money , stories about what people have always done, and will always do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone wants to see the future. Few are good at it. From business to economics, politics to social trends, we’re just not very good at predicting what happens next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Morgan Housel, this is because we focus too much on what we think will change and not enough on what we know will stay the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you traveled in time to 500 years ago or 500 years from now, you would be astounded at how much technology and medicine has changed. The geopolitical order would make no sense to you. The language and dialect may be completely foreign. But you’d notice people falling for greed and fear just like they do in our current world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’d see people persuaded by risk, jealousy, and tribal affiliations in ways that are familiar to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’d see overconfidence and short-sightedness that reminds you of people's behavior today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’d find people seeking the secret to a happy life and trying to find certainty when none exists in ways that are so relatable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When transported to an unfamiliar world, you’d spend a few minutes watching people behave and say, “Ah. I’ve seen this before. Same as ever.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History is filled with surprises no one could have seen coming. But if we learn to see what doesn’t change, we can be more confident in our choices, no matter what the future brings.</description>

  <description>Experience the world of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and the tremendous challenges he faced and overcame with the help of Stoic philosophy&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This novel biography brings Marcus Aurelius (121–180 CE) to life for a new generation of readers by exploring the emperor’s fascinating psychological journey. Donald J. Robertson examines Marcus’s relationships with key figures in his life, such as his mother, Domitia Lucilla, and the emperor Hadrian, as well as his Stoic tutors. He draws extensively on Marcus’s own Meditations and correspondence, and he examines the emperor’s actions as detailed in the Augustan History and other ancient texts.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Marcus Aurelius struggled to reconcile his philosophy and moral values with the political pressures he faced as emperor at the height of Roman power. Robertson examines Marcus’s attitude toward slavery and the moral dilemma posed by capturing enemies in warfare; his attitude toward women; the role of Stoicism in shaping his response to the threat of civil war; the treatment of Christians under his rule; and the naming of his notorious son Commodus as his successor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Throughout, the Meditations is used to shed light on the mind of the emperor—his character, values, and motives—as Robertson skillfully weaves together Marcus’s inner journey as a philosopher with the outer events of his life as a Roman emperor.</description>

  <description>It was January 2021, and Rick Deckard had a license to kill. Somewhere among the hordes of humans out there, lurked several rogue androids. Deckard's assignment--find them and then..."retire" them. Trouble was, the androids all looked exactly like humans, and they didn't want to be found!</description>

  <description>In the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. One of her relatives was shot. Another was poisoned. And this was just the beginning, as more and more Osage were dying under mysterious circumstances, and many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the death toll rose, the newly created FBI took up the case, and the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to try to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including a Native American agent who infiltrated the region, and together with the Osage began to expose one of the most chilling conspiracies in American history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A lone astronaut. An impossible mission. An ally he never imagined.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission—and if he fails, humanity and Earth itself will perish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that right now, he doesn’t know that. He can’t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All he knows is that he’s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he’s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it’s up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery—and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he’s got to do it all alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or does he?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brilliant and engagingly written,&lt;/i&gt; Why Nations Fail &lt;i&gt;answers the question that has stumped the experts for centuries: Why are some nations rich and others poor, divided by wealth and poverty, health and sickness, food and famine? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Is it culture, the weather, geography? Perhaps ignorance of what the right policies are? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply, no. None of these factors is either definitive or destiny. Otherwise, how to explain why Botswana has become one of the fastest growing countries in the world, while other African nations, such as Zimbabwe, the Congo, and Sierra Leone, are mired in poverty and violence? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson conclusively show that it is man-made political and economic institutions that underlie economic success (or lack of it). Korea, to take just one of their fascinating examples, is a remarkably homogeneous nation, yet the people of North Korea are among the poorest on earth while their brothers and sisters in South Korea are among the richest. The south forged a society that created incentives, rewarded innovation, and allowed everyone to participate in economic opportunities. The economic success thus spurred was sustained because the government became accountable and responsive to citizens and the great mass of people. Sadly, the people of the north have endured decades of famine, political repression, and very different economic institutions—with no end in sight. The differences between the Koreas is due to the politics that created these completely different institutional trajectories. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on fifteen years of original research Acemoglu and Robinson marshall extraordinary historical evidence from the Roman Empire, the Mayan city-states, medieval Venice, the Soviet Union, Latin America, England, Europe, the United States, and Africa to build a new theory of political economy with great relevance for the big questions of today, including: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   - China has built an authoritarian growth machine. Will it continue to grow at such high speed and overwhelm the West? &lt;br /&gt;   - Are America’s best days behind it? Are we moving from a virtuous circle in which efforts by elites to aggrandize power are resisted to a vicious one that enriches and empowers a small minority? &lt;br /&gt;   - What is the most effective way to help move billions of people from the rut of poverty to prosperity? More &lt;br /&gt;philanthropy from the wealthy nations of the West? Or learning the hard-won lessons of Acemoglu and Robinson’s breakthrough ideas on the interplay between inclusive political and economic institutions? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why Nations Fail &lt;/i&gt;will change the way you look at—and understand—the world.</description>

  <description>This masterpiece of science (and mathematical) fiction is a delightfully unique and highly entertaining satire that has charmed readers for more than 100 years. The work of English clergyman, educator and Shakespearean scholar Edwin A. Abbott (1838-1926), it describes the journeys of A. Square &lt;i&gt;[sic – ed.]&lt;/i&gt;, a mathematician and resident of the two-dimensional Flatland, where women-thin, straight lines-are the lowliest of shapes, and where men may have any number of sides, depending on their social status.&lt;br /&gt;Through strange occurrences that bring him into contact with a host of geometric forms, Square has adventures in Spaceland (three dimensions), Lineland (one dimension) and Pointland (no dimensions) and ultimately entertains thoughts of visiting a land of four dimensions—a revolutionary idea for which he is returned to his two-dimensional world. Charmingly illustrated by the author, Flatland is not only fascinating reading, it is still a first-rate fictional introduction to the concept of the multiple dimensions of space. "Instructive, entertaining, and stimulating to the imagination." — &lt;i&gt;Mathematics Teacher&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In his New York Times bestselling book Courage is Calling, author Ryan Holiday made the Stoic case for a bold and brave life. In this much-anticipated second book of his Stoic Virtue series, Holiday celebrates the awesome power of self-discipline and those who have seized it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To master anything, one must first master themselves–one’s emotions, one’s thoughts, one’s actions. Eisenhower famously said that freedom is really the opportunity to practice self-discipline. Cicero called the virtue of temperance the polish of life. Without boundaries and restraint, we risk not only failing to meet our full potential and jeopardizing what we have achieved, but we ensure misery and shame. In a world of temptation and excess, this ancient idea is more urgent than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Discipline is Destiny&lt;/i&gt;, Holiday draws on the stories of historical figures we can emulate as pillars of self-discipline, including Lou Gehrig, Queen Elizabeth II, boxer Floyd Patterson, Marcus Aurelius and writer Toni Morrison, as well as the cautionary tales of Napoleon, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Babe Ruth. Through these engaging examples, Holiday teaches readers the power of self-discipline and balance, and cautions against the perils of extravagance and hedonism.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At the heart of Stoicism are four simple virtues: courage, temperance, justice, and wisdom. Everything else, the Stoics believed, flows from them. &lt;i&gt;Discipline is Destiny&lt;/i&gt; will guide readers down the path to self-mastery, upon which all the other virtues depend. Discipline is predictive. You cannot succeed without it. And if you lose it, you cannot help but bring yourself failure and unhappiness.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Heart of Darkness&lt;/i&gt;, a novel by Joseph Conrad, was originally a three-part series in Blackwood's Magazine in 1899. It is a story within a story, following a character named Charlie Marlow, who recounts his adventure to a group of men onboard an anchored ship. The story told is of his early life as a ferry boat captain. Although his job was to transport ivory downriver, Charlie develops an interest in investing an ivory procurement agent, Kurtz, who is employed by the government. Preceded by his reputation as a brilliant emissary of progress, Kurtz has now established himself as a god among the natives in “one of the darkest places on earth.” Marlow suspects something else of Kurtz: he has gone mad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A reflection on corruptive European colonialism and a journey into the nightmare psyche of one of the corrupted, &lt;i&gt;Heart of Darkness&lt;/i&gt; is considered one of the most influential works ever written.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One of the most remarkable true-crime narratives of the twenty-first the story of the world’s most prolific art thief, Stéphane Breitwieser.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this spellbinding portrait of obsession and flawed genius, the best-selling author of &lt;i&gt;The Stranger in the Woods&lt;/i&gt; brings us into Breitwieser’s strange world—unlike most thieves, he never stole for money, keeping all his treasures in a single room where he could admire them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For centuries, works of art have been stolen in countless ways from all over the world, but no one has been quite as successful at it as the master thief Stéphane Breitwieser. Carrying out more than two hundred heists over nearly eight years—in museums and cathedrals all over Europe—Breitwieser, along with his girlfriend who worked as his lookout, stole more than three hundred objects, until it all fell apart in spectacular fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Art Thief&lt;/i&gt;, Michael Finkel brings us into Breitwieser’s strange and fascinating world. Unlike most thieves, Breitwieser never stole for money. Instead, he displayed all his treasures in a pair of secret rooms where he could admire them to his heart’s content. Possessed of a remarkable athleticism and an innate ability to circumvent practically any security system, Breitwieser managed to pull off a breathtaking number of audacious thefts. Yet these strange talents bred a growing disregard for risk and an addict’s need to score, leading Breitwieser to ignore his girlfriend’s pleas to stop—until one final act of hubris brought everything crashing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a riveting story of art, crime, love, and an insatiable hunger to possess beauty at any cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the Academy Award®–winning actor, an unconventional memoir filled with raucous stories, outlaw wisdom, and lessons learned the hard way about living with greater satisfaction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve been in this life for fifty years, been trying to work out its riddle for forty-two, and been keeping diaries of clues to that riddle for the last thirty-five. Notes about successes and failures, joys and sorrows, things that made me marvel, and things that made me laugh out loud. How to be fair. How to have less stress. How to have fun. How to hurt people less. How to get hurt less. How to be a good man. How to have meaning in life. How to be more me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recently, I worked up the courage to sit down with those diaries. I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with life’s challenges - how to get relative with the &lt;i&gt;inevitable&lt;/i&gt; - you can enjoy a state of success I call “catching greenlights.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, it’s medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilot’s license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s a love letter. &lt;b&gt;To life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s also a guide to catching more greenlights - and to realizing that the yellows and reds eventually turn green too.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</description>

  <description>Fred Burnham was fifteen months old in 1862 when his mother hid him in a cornfield, telling him not to move or make any sound. Then she fled a Sioux war party, returning a day later. The cabin was burned, but the boy was where she’d left him, unhurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins a life of adventure, exploration, and military daring seldom found outside the novels of H. Rider Haggard or accounts of the young Theodore Roosevelt—both of whom were Burnham’s friends. He could track any man or animal day or night and had no fear of scouting against the Apaches because he could outrun them. In South Africa, Burnham entered the camp of the Ndebele rebels at night to murder their high priest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burnham lived according to virtues and values that have almost nothing to do with today’s world; Steve Kemper does a magnificent job in bringing this life and all its nuances to the page.</description>

  <description>The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moiraine Damodred arrives in Emond’s Field on a quest to find the one prophesized to stand against The Dark One, a malicious entity sowing the seeds of chaos and destruction. When a vicious band of half-men, half beasts invade the village seeking their master’s enemy, Moiraine persuades Rand al’Thor and his friends to leave their home and enter a larger unimaginable world filled with dangers waiting in the shadows and in the light.</description>

  <description>'Science has never had an advocate quite like David Deutsch ... A computational physicist on a par with his touchstones Alan Turing and Richard Feynman, and a philosopher in the line of his greatest hero, Karl Popper. His arguments are so clear that to read him is to experience the thrill of the highest level of discourse available on this planet and to understand it' Peter Forbes, Independent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In our search for truth, how far have we advanced? This uniquely human quest for good explanations has driven amazing improvements in everything from scientific understanding and technology to politics, moral values and human welfare. But will progress end, either in catastrophe or completion - or will it continue infinitely?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this profound and seminal book, David Deutsch explores the furthest reaches of our current understanding, taking in the Infinity Hotel, supernovae and the nature of optimism, to instill in all of us a wonder at what we have achieved - and the fact that this is only the beginning of humanity's infinite possibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'This is Deutsch at his most ambitious, seeking to understand the implications of our scientific explanations of the world ... I enthusiastically recommend this rich, wide-ranging and elegantly written exposition of the unique insights of one of our most original intellectuals' Michael Berry, Times Higher Education Supplement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Bold ... profound ... provocative and persuasive' Economist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'David Deutsch may well go down in history as one of the great scientists of our age' Scotsman</description>

  <description>"The #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Devil in the White City and Dead Wake delivers a fresh and compelling portrait of Winston Churchill and London during the Blitz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On Winston Churchill's first day as prime minister, Hitler invaded Holland and Belgium. Poland and Czechoslovakia had already fallen, and the Dunkirk evacuation was just two weeks away. For the next twelve months, Hitler would wage a relentless bombing campaign, killing 45,000 Britons. It was up to Churchill to hold the country together and persuade President Franklin Roosevelt that Britain was a worthy ally-and willing to fight to the end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In The Splendid and the Vile, Erik Larson shows, in cinematic detail, how Churchill taught the British people "the art of being fearless." It is a story of political brinkmanship, but it's also an intimate domestic drama set against the backdrop of Churchill's prime-ministerial country home, Chequers; his wartime retreat, Ditchley, where he and his entourage go when the moon is brightest and the bombing threat is highest; and of course 10 Downing Street in London. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on diaries, original archival documents, and once-secret intelligence reports-some released only recently-Larson provides a new lens on London's darkest year through the day-to-day experience of Churchill and his wife, Clementine; their youngest daughter, Mary, who chafes against her parents' wartime protectiveness; their son, Randolph, and his beautiful, unhappy wife, Pamela; Pamela's illicit lover, a dashing American emissary; and the cadre of close advisers who comprised Churchill's "Secret Circle," including his lovestruck private secretary, John Colville; newspaper baron Lord Beaverbrook; and the Rasputin-like Frederick Lindemann. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Splendid and the Vile takes readers out of today's political dysfunction and back to a time of true leadership, when-in the face of unrelenting horror-Churchill's eloquence, courage, and perseverance bound a country, and a family, together."--</description>

  <description>Models is the first book ever written on seduction as an emotional process rather than a logical one, a process of connecting with women rather than impressing them. It's the most mature and honest guide on how a man can attract women without faking behavior, without lying and without emulating others. A game-changer.</description>

  <description>There was a time when running the mile in four minutes was believed to be beyond the limits of human foot speed, and in all of sport it was the elusive holy grail. In 1952, after suffering defeat at the Helsinki Olympics, three world-class runners each set out to break this barrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roger Bannister was a young English medical student who epitomized the ideal of the amateur — still driven not just by winning but by the nobility of the pursuit. John Landy was the privileged son of a genteel Australian family, who as a boy preferred butterfly collecting to running but who trained relentlessly in an almost spiritual attempt to shape his body to this singular task. Then there was Wes Santee, the swaggering American, a Kansas farm boy and natural athlete who believed he was just plain better than everybody else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanning three continents and defying the odds, their collective quest captivated the world and stole headlines from the Korean War, the atomic race, and such legendary figures as Edmund Hillary, Willie Mays, Native Dancer, and Ben Hogan. In the tradition of &lt;i&gt;Seabiscuit&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Chariots of Fire,&lt;/i&gt; Neal Bascomb delivers a breathtaking story of unlikely heroes and leaves us with a lasting portrait of the twilight years of the golden age of sport.</description>

  <description>We all grew up with Aesop’s fable of “The Grasshopper and the Ant.” The grasshopper fiddled and enjoyed his days, while the ant worked assiduously to put his earnings aside for later in life. But suppose the takeaway lesson from that fable was wrong? &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Die with Zero&lt;/i&gt; is a startling new and provocative philosophy as well as practical guide on how to get the most out of your money&lt;/b&gt;—&lt;b&gt;and out of your life.&lt;/b&gt; It’s intended for those who place lifelong memorable experiences ahead of simply making the most of their savings. In the same vein as the classic bestsellers &lt;i&gt;The 4-Hour Workweek&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Die Broke,&lt;/i&gt; Bill Perkins offers a brand-new roadmap as to what’s the ideal age to transform your hard-earned savings into meaningful lifelong experiences. He makes it clear that you need to take stock of your life, and to understand that always postponing your dreams and wishes until you’re in your so-called Golden Years doesn’t make sense. In short, Perkins has turned the fable of “The Grasshopper and the Ant” upside down—and he explains why his practical approach to enjoying our limited time on earth makes sense in today’s fast-paced world.</description>

  <description>The year is 2029, and nothing is as it should be. The very essence of American life, the dollar, is under attack. In a coordinated move by the rest of the world’s governments, the dollar loses all its value. The American President declares that the States will default on all its loans–prices skyrocket, currency becomes essentially worthless, and we watch one family struggle to survive through it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mandibles can count on their inheritance no longer, and each member must come to terms with this in their own way–from the elegant expat author Nollie, in her middle age, returning to the U.S. from Paris after many years abroad, to her precocious teenage nephew Willing, who is the only one to actually understand the crisis, to the brilliant Georgetown economics professor Lowell, who watches his whole vision of the world disintegrate before his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As ever, in her new novel, Shriver draws larger than life characters who illuminate this complicated, ever-changing world. One of our sharpest observers of human nature, Shriver challenges us to think long and hard about the society we live in and what, ultimately, we hold most dear.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Killers of the Flower Moon&lt;/i&gt;, a page-turning story of shipwreck, survival, and savagery, culminating in a court martial that reveals a shocking truth. The powerful narrative reveals the deeper meaning of the events on the &lt;i&gt;Wager&lt;/i&gt;, showing that it was not only the captain and crew who ended up on trial, but the very idea of empire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On January 28, 1742, a ramshackle vessel of patched-together wood and cloth washed up on the coast of Brazil. Inside were thirty emaciated men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell. They were survivors of His Majesty's Ship the &lt;i&gt;Wager&lt;/i&gt;, a British vessel that had left England in 1740 on a secret mission during an imperial war with Spain. While the &lt;i&gt;Wager&lt;/i&gt; had been chasing a Spanish treasure-filled galleon known as "the prize of all the oceans," it had wrecked on a desolate island off the coast of Patagonia. The men, after being marooned for months and facing starvation, built the flimsy craft and sailed for more than a hundred days, traversing nearly 3,000 miles of storm-wracked seas. They were greeted as heroes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then . . . six months later, another, even more decrepit craft landed on the coast of Chile. This boat contained just three castaways, and they told a very different story. The thirty sailors who landed in Brazil were not heroes - they were mutineers. The first group responded with countercharges of their own, of a tyrannical and murderous senior officer and his henchmen. It became clear that while stranded on the island the crew had fallen into anarchy, with warring factions fighting for dominion over the barren wilderness. As accusations of treachery and murder flew, the Admiralty convened a court martial to determine who was telling the truth. The stakes were life-and-death--for whomever the court found guilty could hang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Wager&lt;/i&gt; is a grand tale of human behavior at the extremes told by one of our greatest nonfiction writers. Grann's recreation of the hidden world on a British warship rivals the work of Patrick O'Brian, his portrayal of the castaways' desperate straits stands up to the classics of survival writing such as &lt;i&gt;The Endurance&lt;/i&gt;, and his account of the court martial has the savvy of a Scott Turow thriller. As always with Grann's work, the incredible twists of the narrative hold the reader spellbound.</description>

  <description>Nearly seventy years after its original publication, Ray Bradbury’s internationally acclaimed novel Fahrenheit 451 stands as a classic of world literature set in a bleak, dystopian future. Today its message has grown more relevant than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guy Montag is a fireman. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television “family.” But when he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Medium Raw &lt;/em&gt;marks the return of the inimitable Anthony Bourdain, author of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;em&gt;Kitchen Confidential &lt;/em&gt;and three-time Emmy Award-nominated host of &lt;em&gt;No Reservations &lt;/em&gt;on TV’s Travel Channel. Bourdain calls his book, “A Bloody Valentine to the World of Food and the People Who Cook,” and he is at his entertaining best as he takes aim at some of the biggest names in the foodie world, including David Chang, Alice Waters, the Top Chef winners and losers, and many more. If Hunter S. Thompson had written a book about the restaurant business, it could have been &lt;em&gt;Medium Raw.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Isaac Asimov's I, Robot launches readers on an adventure into a not-so-distant future where man and machine , struggle to redefinelife, love, and consciousness—and where the stakes are nothing less than survival. Filled with unforgettable characters, mind-bending speculation, and nonstop action, I, Robot is a powerful reading experience from one of the master storytellers of our time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, ROBOT &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They mustn't harm a human being, they must obey human orders, and they must protect their own existence...but only so long as that doesn't violate rules one and two. With these Three Laws of Robotics, humanity embarked on perhaps its greatest adventure: the invention of the first positronic man. It was a bold new era of evolution that would open up enormous possibilities—and unforeseen risks. For the scientists who invented the earliest robots weren't content that their creations should ' remain programmed helpers, companions, and semisentient worker-machines. And soon the robots themselves; aware of their own intelligence, power, and humanity, aren't either. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As humans and robots struggle to survive together—and sometimes against each other—on earth and in space, the future of both hangs in the balance. Human men and women confront robots gone mad, telepathic robots, robot politicians, and vast robotic intelligences that may already secretly control the world. And both are asking the same questions: What is human? And is humanity obsolete? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In l, Robot Isaac Asimov changes forever our perception of robots, and human beings and updates the timeless myth of man's dream to play god. with all its rewards—and terrors.&lt;br /&gt;--front flap</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/i&gt; and other bestselling biographies, this is the astonishingly intimate story of the most fascinating and controversial innovator of our era—a rule-breaking visionary who helped to lead the world into the era of electric vehicles, private space exploration, and artificial intelligence. Oh, and took over Twitter.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Elon Musk was a kid in South Africa, he was regularly beaten by bullies. One day a group pushed him down some concrete steps and kicked him until his face was a swollen ball of flesh. He was in the hospital for a week. But the physical scars were minor compared to the emotional ones inflicted by his father, an engineer, rogue, and charismatic fantasist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His father’s impact on his psyche would linger. He developed into a tough yet vulnerable man-child, prone to abrupt Jekyll-and-Hyde mood swings, with an exceedingly high tolerance for risk, a craving for drama, an epic sense of mission, and a maniacal intensity that was callous and at times destructive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning of 2022—after a year marked by SpaceX launching thirty-one rockets into orbit, Tesla selling a million cars, and him becoming the richest man on earth—Musk spoke ruefully about his compulsion to stir up dramas. “I need to shift my mindset away from being in crisis mode, which it has been for about fourteen years now, or arguably most of my life,” he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a wistful comment, not a New Year’s resolution. Even as he said it, he was secretly buying up shares of Twitter, the world’s ultimate playground. Over the years, whenever he was in a dark place, his mind went back to being bullied on the playground. Now he had the chance to own the playground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two years, Isaacson shadowed Musk, attended his meetings, walked his factories with him, and spent hours interviewing him, his family, friends, coworkers, and adversaries. The result is the revealing inside story, filled with amazing tales of triumphs and turmoil, that addresses the are the demons that drive Musk also what it takes to drive innovation and progress?</description>

  <description>Hidden somewhere, in nearly every major city in the world, is an underground seduction lair. And in these lairs, men trade the most devastatingly effective techniques ever invented to charm women. This is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; fiction. These men really exist. They live together in houses known as Projects. And Neil Strauss, the bestselling author, spent two years living among them, using the pseudonym Style to protect his real-life identity. The result is one of the most explosive and controversial books of the year—guaranteed to change the lives of men and transform the way women understand the opposite sex forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On his journey from AFC (average frustrated chump) to PUA (pick-up artist) to PUG (pick-up guru), Strauss not only shares scores of original seduction techniques but also has unforgettable encounters with the likes of Tom Cruise, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Heidi Fleiss, and Courtney Love. And then things really start to get strange—and passions lead to betrayals lead to violence. &lt;i&gt;The Game&lt;/i&gt; is the story of one man's transformation from frog to prince—to prisoner in the most unforgettable book of the year.</description>

  <description>A preeminent scientist - and the world's most prominent atheist - asserts the irrationality of belief in God, and the grievous harm religion has inflicted on society, from the Crusades to 9/11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With rigor and wit, Dawkins examines God in all his forms, from the sex-obsessed tyrant of the Old Testament, to the more benign (but still illogical) Celestial Watchmaker favored by some Enlightenment thinkers. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion, and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt; makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong, but potentially deadly. It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual and society, not the least of which is a clearer, truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could ever muster.</description>

  <description>An epic account of the decades-long battle to control what has emerged as the world's most critical resource—microchip technology—with the United States and China increasingly in conflict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be surprised to learn that microchips are the new oil—the scarce resource on which the modern world depends. Today, military, economic, and geopolitical power are built on a foundation of computer chips. Virtually &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;— from missiles to microwaves, smartphones to the stock market — runs on chips. Until recently, America designed and built the fastest chips and maintained its lead as the #1 superpower. Now, America's edge is slipping, undermined by competitors in Taiwan, Korea, Europe, and, above all, China. Today, as &lt;i&gt;Chip War&lt;/i&gt; reveals, China, which spends more money each year importing chips than it spends importing oil, is pouring billions into a chip-building initiative to catch up to the US. At stake is America's military superiority and economic prosperity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Economic historian Chris Miller explains how the semiconductor came to play a critical role in modern life and how the U.S. become dominant in chip design and manufacturing and applied this technology to military systems. America's victory in the Cold War and its global military dominance stems from its ability to harness computing power more effectively than any other power. But here, too, China is catching up, with its chip-building ambitions and military modernization going hand in hand. America has let key components of the chip-building process slip out of its grasp, contributing not only to a worldwide chip shortage but also a new Cold War with a superpower adversary that is desperate to bridge the gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Illuminating, timely, and fascinating, &lt;i&gt;Chip War&lt;/i&gt; shows that, to make sense of the current state of politics, economics, and technology, we must first understand the vital role played by chips.</description>

  <description>From Andre Agassi, one of the most beloved athletes in history and one of the most gifted men ever to step onto a tennis court, a beautiful, haunting autobiography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agassi’s incredibly rigorous training begins when he is just a child. By the age of thirteen, he is banished to a Florida tennis camp that feels like a prison camp. Lonely, scared, a ninth-grade dropout, he rebels in ways that will soon make him a 1980s icon. He dyes his hair, pierces his ears, dresses like a punk rocker. By the time he turns pro at sixteen, his new look promises to change tennis forever, as does his lightning-fast return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet, despite his raw talent, he struggles early on. We feel his confusion as he loses to the world’s best, his greater confusion as he starts to win. After stumbling in three Grand Slam finals, Agassi shocks the world, and himself, by capturing the 1992 Wimbledon. Overnight he becomes a fan favorite and a media target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agassi brings a near-photographic memory to every pivotal match and every relationship. Never before has the inner game of tennis and the outer game of fame been so precisely limned. Alongside vivid portraits of rivals from several generations—Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer—Agassi gives unstinting accounts of his brief time with Barbra Streisand and his doomed marriage to Brooke Shields. He reveals a shattering loss of confidence. And he recounts his spectacular resurrection, a comeback climaxing with his epic run at the 1999 French Open and his march to become the oldest man ever ranked number one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In clear, taut prose, Agassi evokes his loyal brother, his wise coach, his gentle trainer, all the people who help him regain his balance and find love at last with Stefanie Graf. Inspired by her quiet strength, he fights through crippling pain from a deteriorating spine to remain a dangerous opponent in the twenty-first and final year of his career. Entering his last tournament in 2006, he’s hailed for completing a stunning metamorphosis, from nonconformist to elder statesman, from dropout to education advocate. And still he’s not done. At a U.S. Open for the ages, he makes a courageous last stand, then delivers one of the most stirring farewells ever heard in a sporting arena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its breakneck tempo and raw candor, Open will be read and cherished for years. A treat for ardent fans, it will also captivate readers who know nothing about tennis. Like Agassi’s game, it sets a new standard for grace, style, speed, and power.</description>

  <description>Will Durant once wrote that "most history is guessing, &amp;amp; the rest is prejudice." Now, 33 years later, the Durants, in this peroration to their monumental "Story of Civilization," look back to record the lessons &amp;amp; conclusions of their 10-volume excursion into human folly &amp;amp; achievement--&amp;amp;, coincidentally, to determine what value historical guesswork &amp;amp; historians' predispositions may have in understanding the nature of humanity. Their reflections are thematic in nature, discussing the influence &amp;amp; effect upon history of certain qualities, institutions &amp;amp; race, character, moral systems, religion, socialism, government, war etc. Their overall conclusion is at once optimistic &amp;amp; realistic; the phenomenon of progress is no figment of the historian's imagination; it's real, in the sense that each generation is born to a heritage richer than that received by their fathers. Thus, the 20th century is the most blessed of all eras so far, from a cultural standpoint, for it has assimilated the best of the Periclean Greeks, of the Renaissance, of the Voltairian age etc. The Durants' "Story" is, despite the cavils of a few disputatious historians, the historical synthesis par excellence for the intelligent nonspecialist. The Lessons of History, despite its extreme brevity, forms an integrally necessary part of that opus &amp;amp; must be read as such, or as an independent work in the tradition of Augustine's Retractationes &amp;amp; Toynbee's Reconsiderations.--Kirkus (edited)</description>

  <description>Chuck Palahniuk showed himself to be his generation’s most visionary satirist in this, his first book. &lt;em&gt;Fight Club&lt;/em&gt;’s estranged narrator leaves his lackluster job when he comes under the thrall of Tyler Durden, an enigmatic young man who holds secret after-hours boxing matches in the basement of bars. There, two men fight "as long as they have to." This is a gloriously original work that exposes the darkness at the core of our modern world.</description>

  <description>What Makes Sammy Run?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone of us knows someone who runs. He is one of the symp-toms of our times—from the little man who shoves you out of the way on the street to the go-getter who shoves you out of a job in the office to the Fuehrer who shoves you out of the world. And all of us have stopped to wonder, at some time or another, what it is that makes these people tick. What makes them run?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the question Schulberg has asked himself, and the answer is the first novel written with the indignation that only a young writer with talent and ideals could concentrate into a manuscript. It is the story of Sammy Glick, the man with a positive genius for being a heel, who runs through New York’s East Side, through newspaper ranks and finally through Hollywood, leaving in his wake the wrecked careers of his associates; for this is his tragedy and his chief characteristic—his congenital incapacity for friendship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An older and more experienced novelist might have tempered his story and, in so doing, destroyed one of its outstanding qualities. Compromise would mar the portrait of Sammy Glick. Schulberg has etched it in pure vitriol, and dissected his victim with a precision that is almost frightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a fragment of this book appeared as a short story in a national magazine, Schulberg was surprised at the number of letters he received from people convinced they knew Sammy Glick’s real name. But speculation as to his real identity would be utterly fruitless, for Sammy is a composite picture of a loud and spectacular minority bitterly resented by the many decent and sincere artists who are trying honestly to realize the measureless potentialities of motion pictures. To this group belongs Schulberg himself, who has not only worked as a screen writer since his graduation from Dartmouth College in 1936, but has spent his life, literally, in the heart of the motion-picture colony. In the course of finding out what makes Sammy run (an operation in which the reader is spared none of the grue-some details) Schulberg has poured out everything he has felt about that place. The result is a book which the publishers not only believe to be the most honest ever written about Hollywood, but a penetrating study of one kind of twentieth-century success that is peculiar to no single race of people or walk of life.</description>

  <description>General Chuck Yeager, the greatest test pilot of them all -- the first man to fly faster than the speed of sound . . .the World War II flying ace who shot down a Messerschmitt jet with a prop-driven P-51 Mustang . . .the hero who defined a certain quality that all hotshot fly-boys of the postwar era aimed to achieve: the right stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Chuck Yeager tells his whole incredible life story with the same "wide-open, full throttle" approach that has marked his astonishing career.  What it was really like enaging in do-or-die dogfights over Nazi Europe.  How after being shot over occupied France, Yeager somehow managed to escape.  The amazing behind-the-scenes story of smashing the sound barrier despite cracked ribs from a riding accident days before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire story is here, in Yeager's own words, and in wondeful insights from his wife and those friends and colleagues who have known him best.  It is the personal and public story of a man who settled for nothing less than excellence, a one-of-a-kind portrait of a true American hero.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The incredible true story of the card-counting mathematics professor who taught the world how to beat the dealer and, as the first of the great quantitative investors, ushered in a revolution on Wall Street.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A child of the Great Depression, legendary mathematician Edward O. Thorp invented card counting, proving the seemingly impossible: that you could beat the dealer at the blackjack table. As a result he launched a gambling renaissance. His remarkable success--and mathematically unassailable method--caused such an uproar that casinos altered the rules of the game to thwart him and the legions he inspired. They barred him from their premises, even put his life in jeopardy. Nonetheless, gambling was forever changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thereafter, Thorp shifted his sights to "the biggest casino in the world" Wall Street. Devising and then deploying mathematical formulas to beat the market, Thorp ushered in the era of quantitative finance we live in today. Along the way, the so-called godfather of the quants played bridge with Warren Buffett, crossed swords with a young Rudy Giuliani, detected the Bernie Madoff scheme, and, to beat the game of roulette, invented, with Claude Shannon, the world's first wearable computer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, for the first time, Thorp tells the story of what he did, how he did it, his passions and motivations, and the curiosity that has always driven him to disregard conventional wisdom and devise game-changing solutions to seemingly insoluble problems. An intellectual thrill ride, replete with practical wisdom that can guide us all in uncertain financial waters, &lt;i&gt;A Man for All Markets&lt;/i&gt; is an instant classic--a book that challenges its readers to think logically about a seemingly irrational world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;A Man for All Markets&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"In &lt;i&gt;A Man for All Markets&lt;/i&gt;, [Thorp] delightfully recounts his progress (if that is the word) from college teacher to gambler to hedge-fund manager. Along the way we learn important lessons about the functioning of markets and the logic of investment."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"[Thorp] gives a biological summation (think Richard Feynman's &lt;i&gt;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!&lt;/i&gt;) of his quest to prove the aphorism 'the house always wins' is flawed. . . . Illuminating for the mathematically inclined, and cautionary for would-be gamblers and day traders"&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Foundation and Empire tells the incredible story of a new breed of man who create a new force for galactic government. Thus, the Foundation hurtles into conflict with the decadent, decrepit First Empire. In this struggle for power amid the chaos of the stars, man stands at the threshold of a new, enlightened life which could easily be put aside for the old forces of barbarism. The Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov constitute what is very likely the most famed epic in all of science-fiction</description>

  <description>In this eye-opening account, Cal Newport debunks the long-held belief that "follow your passion" is good advice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the cliché flawed—preexisting passions are rare and have little to do with how most people end up loving their work—but it can also be dangerous, leading to anxiety and chronic job hopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After making his case against passion, Newport sets out on a quest to discover the reality of how people end up loving what they do. Spending time with organic farmers, venture capitalists, screenwriters, freelance computer programmers, and others who admitted to deriving great satisfaction from their work, Newport uncovers the strategies they used and the pitfalls they avoided in developing their compelling careers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matching your job to a preexisting passion does not matter, he reveals. Passion comes after you put in the hard work to become excellent at something valuable, not before. In other words, what you do for a living is much less important than how you do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a title taken from the comedian Steve Martin, who once said his advice for aspiring entertainers was to "be so good they can't ignore you," Cal Newport's clearly written manifesto is mandatory reading for anyone fretting about what to do with their life, or frustrated by their current job situation and eager to find a fresh new way to take control of their livelihood. He provides an evidence-based blueprint for creating work you love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;So Good They Can't Ignore You&lt;/i&gt; will change the way we think about our careers, happiness, and the crafting of a remarkable life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first novel in Isaac Asimov's classic science-fiction masterpiece, the Foundation series &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. Now it is dying. But only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future--to a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save humankind, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire--both scientists and scholars--and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for future generations. He calls his sanctuary the Foundation.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A breakthrough program for triathletes at all levels--showing how to train at low intensity to maximize performance--from a popular fitness author and elite coach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recent research has proven that triathletes and other endurance athletes experience the greatest improvements in performance and fitness when they do 80 percent of their training at low intensity and the remaining 20 percent at moderate to high intensity. But the vast majority of recreational triathletes are caught in the so-called "moderate-intensity rut," spending almost half of their training time too hard--harder than the pros. Training harder isn't smarter; it results in low-grade chronic fatigue that prevents them from getting the best results. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;80/20 Triathlon&lt;/i&gt;, Fitzgerald and Warden lay out the real-world and scientific evidence, offering concrete tips, strategies, and complete training plans to help athletes implement the 80/20 Rule of intensity balance. Benefits include reduced fatigue and injury risk, improved fitness, increased motivation, and better race results.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This is not a self-help book. It's a wake-up call!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can't Hurt Me&lt;/i&gt;, David Goggins' smash hit memoir, demonstrated how much untapped ability we all have but was merely an introduction to the power of the mind. In &lt;i&gt;Never Finished&lt;/i&gt;, Goggins takes you inside his Mental Lab, where he developed the philosophy, psychology, and strategies that enabled him to learn that what he thought was his limit was only his beginning and that the quest for greatness is unending. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stories and lessons in this raw, revealing, unflinching memoir offer the reader a blueprint they can use to climb from the bottom of the barrel into a whole new stratosphere that once seemed unattainable. Whether you feel off-course in life, are looking to maximize your potential or drain your soul to break through your so-called glass ceiling, this is the only book you will ever need.</description>

  <description>As Sam Walton himself said, this is "...a story about entrepreneurship, and risk, and hard work, and knowing where you want to go and being willing to do what it takes to get there. And it's a story about believing in your idea even when maybe some other folks don't, and about sticking to your guns." It's the story of how Walton parlayed a single dime store in a hardscrabble cotton town into Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world. The undisputed merchant king of the late twentieth century, he never lost the common touch. Here Walton tells his extraordinary story in his own inimitable words. Genuinely modest, but always sure of his ambitions and achievements, Walton shares his thinking in a candid, straight-from-the-shoulder style.&lt;br /&gt;"Here is an extraordinary success story about a man whose empire was built not with smoke and mirrors, but with good old-fashioned elbow grease."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A deluxe, annotated edition of &lt;i&gt;Kitchen Confidential&lt;/i&gt; to celebrate the life of Anthony Bourdain, featuring new photo inserts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over two decades ago, the &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; published a now infamous article, “Don’t Eat Before Reading This,” by then little-known chef Anthony Bourdain. Bourdain spared no one’s appetite as he revealed what happens behind the kitchen door. The article was a sensation, and the book it spawned, the now iconic &lt;i&gt;Kitchen Confidential&lt;/i&gt;, became an even bigger sensation and megabestseller. Frankly confessional, addictively acerbic, and utterly unsparing, Bourdain pulls no punches in this memoir of his years in the restaurant business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans will love to return to this deliciously funny, delectably shocking banquet of wild-but-true tales of life in the culinary trade, laying out Bourdain’s more than a quarter-century of drugs, sex, and haute cuisine. Including a handwritten introduction and annotations done by Bourdain about a decade after the book was originally published, this edition also features previously unpublished photos to accompany the now-classic text.</description>

  <description>While the history books are filled with tales of obsessive, visionary geniuses who remade the world in their image with sheer, almost irrational force, I’ve found that history is also made by individuals who fought their egos at every turn, who eschewed the spotlight, and who put their higher goals above their desire for recognition.” – from the Prologue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of us insist the main impediment to a full, successful life is the outside world. In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Ego is the Enemy&lt;/i&gt; draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to history. We meet fascinating figures like Howard Hughes, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt, all of whom reached the highest levels of power and success by conquering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics can be ours as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But why should we bother fighting ego in an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of shameless self-promotion? Armed with the lessons in this book, as Holiday writes, “you will be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work you’ve set out to achieve.</description>

  <description>The definitive biography of the founder of history's greatest empire. In 25 years, Genghis Khan and his Mongol armies conquered more than the Romans had in four centuries, founding the most extensive empire humankind has ever seen. Born Temujin, a pariah from the steppes, the man destined to make history as the Great Khan of the Mongols conquered every territory he held, from Georgia and Armenia to Korea. Genghis Khan emerged as an unexpected leader, abolishing torture, guaranteeing religious freedom, and destroying feudal systems based on aristocratic privilege. When he was born, holding a blood clot in his hand, his mother predicted that the child would change the course of the world. Thus, Genghis Khan united all the Mongol tribes of the steppes and transformed their way of life. He created the most efficient army of the Middle Ages, opened trade routes that connected the known world, and founded an empire that stretched from Europe to East Asia. His successors were kings, khans, and emperors in China, India, and Russia, and his legacy was enduring. From the early life of Genghis Khan and his rise and transformation from the tribal world of the steppes to the civilizing explosion of the Mongol Empire, this brilliant essay by Jack Weatherford, an anthropologist specializing in Mongol history, tells the epic story of how the modern world was forged.</description>

  <description>Getting rich is not just about luck; Happiness is not just a trait we are born with. These aspirations may seem out of reach, but building wealth and being happy are skills we can learn. So what are these skills, and how do we learn them? What are the principles that should guide our efforts? What does progress really look like? Naval Ravikant is an entrepreneur, philosopher, and investor who has captivated the world with his principles for building wealth and creating long-term happiness. The Almanack of Naval Ravikant is a collection of Naval’s wisdom and experience from the last ten years, shared as a curation of his most insightful interviews and poignant reflections. This isn’t a how-to book, or a step-by-step gimmick. Instead, through Naval’s own words, you will learn how to walk your own unique path toward a happier, wealthier life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The bestselling classic that examines the history of economic thought from Adam Smith to Karl Marx—“all the economic lore most general readers conceivably could want to know, served up with a flourish” (The New York Times).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Worldly Philosophers&lt;/i&gt; not only enables us to see more deeply into our history but helps us better understand our own times. In this seventh edition, Robert L. Heilbroner provides a new theme that connects thinkers as diverse as Adam Smith and Karl Marx. The theme is the common focus of their highly varied ideas—namely, the search to understand how a capitalist society works. It is a focus never more needed than in this age of confusing economic headlines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a bold new concluding chapter entitled “The End of the Worldly Philosophy?” Heilbroner reminds us that the word “end” refers to both the purpose and limits of economics. This chapter conveys a concern that today’s increasingly “scientific” economics may overlook fundamental social and political issues that are central to economics. Thus, unlike its predecessors, this new edition provides not just an indispensable illumination of our past but a call to action for our future.</description>

  <description>Raskolnikov, a destitute and desperate former student, wanders through the slums of St Petersburg and commits a random murder without remorse or regret. He imagines himself to be a great man, a Napoleon: acting for a higher purpose beyond conventional moral law. But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck. Only Sonya, a downtrodden sex worker, can offer the chance of redemption.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It's Christmas time and Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from yet another school...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fleeing the crooks at Pencey Prep, he pinballs around New York City seeking solace in fleeting encounters—shooting the bull with strangers in dive hotels, wandering alone round Central Park, getting beaten up by pimps and cut down by erstwhile girlfriends. The city is beautiful and terrible, in all its neon loneliness and seedy glamour, its mingled sense of possibility and emptiness. Holden passes through it like a ghost, thinking always of his kid sister Phoebe, the only person who really understands him, and his determination to escape the phonies and find a life of true meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Catcher in the Rye&lt;/i&gt; is an all-time classic in coming-of-age literature- an elegy to teenage alienation, capturing the deeply human need for connection and the bewildering sense of loss as we leave childhood behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/819789.J_D__Salinger_s" title="J.D. Salinger's" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;J.D. Salinger's&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (1919–2010) classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt;'s 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.</description>

  <description>The Godfather—the epic tale of crime and betrayal that became a global phenomenon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost fifty years ago, a classic was born. A searing portrayal of the Mafia underworld, The Godfather introduced readers to the first family of American crime fiction, the Corleones, and their powerful legacy of tradition, blood, and honor. The seduction of power, the pitfalls of greed, and the allegiance to family—these are the themes that have resonated with millions of readers around the world and made The Godfather the definitive novel of the violent subculture that, steeped in intrigue and controversy, remains indelibly etched in our collective consciousness.</description>

  <description>In this candid and riveting memoir, for the first time ever, Nike founder and CEO Phil Knight shares the inside story of the company’s early days as an intrepid start-up and its evolution into one of the world’s most iconic, game-changing, and profitable brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the &lt;i&gt;ne plus ultra&lt;/i&gt; of all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, in a memoir that is candid, humble, gutsy, and wry, he tells his story, beginning with his crossroads moment. At 24, after backpacking around the world, he decided to take the unconventional path, to start his own business—a business that would be dynamic, &lt;i&gt;different.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knight details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream—along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls the formative relationships with his first partners and employees, a ragtag group of misfits and seekers who became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A quest across America, from the northernmost tip of Maine to California’s Monterey Peninsula&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To hear the speech of the real America, to smell the grass and the trees, to see the colors and the light—these were John Steinbeck's goals as he set out, at the age of fifty-eight, to rediscover the country he had been writing about for so many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Charley, his French poodle, Steinbeck drives the interstates and the country roads, dines with truckers, encounters bears at Yellowstone and old friends in San Francisco. Along the way he reflects on the American character, racial hostility, the particular form of American loneliness he finds almost everywhere, and the unexpected kindness of strangers.</description>

  <description>The Japanese phenomenon that teaches us the simple yet profound lessons required to liberate our real selves and find lasting happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Courage to Be Disliked&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to unlock the power within yourself to become your best and truest self, change your future and find lasting happiness. Using the theories of Alfred Adler, one of the three giants of 19th-century psychology alongside Freud and Jung, the authors explain how we are all free to determine our own future free of the shackles of past experiences, doubts and the expectations of others. It’s a philosophy that’s profoundly liberating, allowing us to develop the courage to change, and to ignore the limitations that we and those around us can place on ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is a book that is both highly accessible and profound in its importance. Millions have already read and benefited from its wisdom. Now that The Courage to Be Disliked has been published for the first time in English, so can you.</description>

  <description>Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing, &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/i&gt; is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and tour de force.</description>

  <description>The Plague is a novel by Albert Camus, published in 1947. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tells the story from the point of view of a narrator of a plague sweeping the French Algerian city of Oran. The narrator remains unknown until the start of the last chapter, chapter 5 of part 5. The novel presents a snapshot of life in Oran as seen through the author's distinctive absurdist point of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book tells a gripping tale of human unrelieved horror, of survival and resilience, and of the ways in which humankind confronts death, The Plague is at once a masterfully crafted novel, eloquently understated and epic in scope, and a parable of ageless moral resonance, profoundly relevant to our times. In Oran, a coastal town in North Africa, the plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people. It gradually becomes an omnipresent reality, obliterating all traces of the past and driving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of suffering, madness, and compassion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Plague is considered an existentialist classic despite Camus' objection to the label. The novel stresses the powerlessness of the individual characters to affect their destinies. The narrative tone is similar to Kafka's, especially in The Trial, whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings; the material often pointedly resonating as stark allegory of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition.</description>

  <description>Since its U.S. debut almost fifty years ago, this brilliant text has set a new standard for historical scholarship of Latin America. It is also an outstanding political economy, a social and cultural narrative of the highest quality, and perhaps the finest description of primitive capital accumulation since Marx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than chronology, geography, or political successions, Eduardo Galeano has organized the various facets of Latin American history according to the patterns of five centuries of exploitation. Thus he is concerned with gold and silver, cacao and cotton, rubber and coffee, fruit, hides and wool, petroleum, iron, nickel, manganese, copper, aluminum ore, nitrates, and tin. These are the veins which he traces through the body of the entire continent, up to the Rio Grande and throughout the Caribbean, and all the way to their open ends where they empty into the coffers of wealth in the United States and Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaving fact and imagery into a rich tapestry, Galeano fuses scientific analysis with the passions of a plundered and suffering people. An immense gathering of materials is framed with a vigorous style that never falters in its command of themes. All readers interested in great historical, economic, political, and social writing will find a singular analytical achievement, and an overwhelming narrative that makes history speak, unforgettably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This classic is now further honored by Isabel Allende’s inspiring introduction. Universally recognized as one of the most important writers of our time, Allende once again contributes her talents to literature, to political principles, and to enlightenment.</description>

  <description>Rusty Young was backpacking in South America when he heard about Thomas McFadden, a convicted English drug trafficker who ran tours inside Bolivia's notorious San Pedro prison. Intrigued, the young Australian journalisted went to La Paz and joined one of Thomas's illegal tours. They formed an instant friendship and then became partners in an attempt to record Thomas's experiences in the jail. Rusty bribed the guards to allow him to stay and for the next three months he lived inside the prison, sharing a cell with Thomas and recording one of the strangest and most compelling prison stories of all time. The result is Marching Powder .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book establishes that San Pedro is not your average prison. Inmates are expected to buy their cells from real estate agents. Others run shops and restaurants. Women and children live with imprisoned family members. It is a place where corrupt politicians and drug lords live in luxury apartments, while the poorest prisoners are subjected to squalor and deprivation. Violence is a constant threat, and sections of San Pedro that echo with the sound of children by day house some of Bolivia's busiest cocaine laboratories by night. In San Pedro, cocaine--"Bolivian marching powder"--makes life bearable. Even the prison cat is addicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Marching Powder is also the tale of friendship, a place where horror is countered by humor and cruelty and compassion can inhabit the same cell. This is cutting-edge travel-writing and a fascinating account of infiltration into the South American drug culture.</description>

  <description>HarperCollins is proud to present its incredible range of best-loved, essential classics.&lt;br /&gt; No man can live a happy life, or even a supportable life, without the study of wisdom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucius Annaeus Seneca (4 BC-AD 65) is one of the most famous Roman philosophers. Instrumental in guiding the Roman Empire under emperor Nero, Seneca influenced him from a young age with his Stoic principles. Later in life, he wrote Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium, or Letters from a Stoic, detailing these principles in full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seneca’s letters read like a diary or a handbook of philosophical meditations. Often beginning with observations on daily life, the letters focus on many traditional themes of Stoic philosophy, such as the contempt of death, the value of friendship, and virtue as the supreme good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Gummere’s translation from the early twentieth century, this selection of Seneca’s letters shows his belief in the austere, ethical ideals of Stoicism – teachings we can still learn from today.</description>

  <description>"Long live the King" hailed Entertainment Weekly upon the publication of Stephen King's On Writing. Part memoir, part master class by one of the bestselling authors of all time, this superb volume is a revealing and practical view of the writer's craft, comprising the basic tools of the trade every writer must have. King's advice is grounded in his vivid memories from childhood through his emergence as a writer, from his struggling early career to his widely reported near-fatal accident in 1999 -- and how the inextricable link between writing and living spurred his recovery. Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, On Writing will empower and entertain everyone who reads it -- fans, writers, and anyone who loves a great story well told.&lt;br /&gt;(back cover)</description>

  <description>A national bestseller when it first appeared in 1963, &lt;em&gt;The Fire Next Time&lt;/em&gt; galvanized the nation and gave passionate voice to the emerging civil rights movement. At once a powerful evocation of James Baldwin’s early life in Harlem and a disturbing examination of the consequences of racial injustice, the book is an intensely personal and provocative document. It consists of two “letters,” written on the occasion of the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation, that exhort Americans, both black and white, to attack the terrible legacy of racism. Described by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt; as “sermon, ultimatum, confession, deposition, testament, and chronicle…all presented in searing, brilliant prose,” &lt;em&gt;The Fire Next Time&lt;/em&gt; stands as a classic of our literature.</description>

  <description>Published in 1942 by French author Albert Camus, &lt;i&gt;The Stranger&lt;/i&gt; has long been considered a classic of twentieth-century literature. &lt;i&gt;Le Monde&lt;/i&gt; ranks it as number one on its "100 Books of the Century" list. Through this story of an ordinary man unwittingly drawn into a senseless murder on a sundrenched Algerian beach, Camus explores what he termed "the nakedness of man faced with the absurd."</description>

  <description>This is a story for people who follow their hearts and make their own rules...people who get special pleasure out of doing something well, even if only for themselves...people who know there's more to this living than meets the eye: they’ll be right there with Jonathan, flying higher and faster than ever they dreamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan Livingston Seagull is no ordinary bird. He believes it is every gull's right to fly, to reach the ultimate freedom of challenge and discovery, finding his greatest reward in teaching younger gulls the joy of flight and the power of dreams. The special 20th anniversary release of this spiritual classic!</description>

  <description>Fifty years after its original publication, Catch-22 remains a cornerstone of American literature and one of the funniest—and most celebrated—books of all time. In recent years it has been named to “best novels” lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and much more. Here, at last, is the definitive edition of a classic of world literature.</description>

  <description>"Diamond has written a book of remarkable scope ... one of the most important and readable works on the human past published in recent years."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and a national bestseller: the global account of the rise of civilization that is also a stunning refutation of ideas of human development based on race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this "artful, informative, and delightful" (William H. McNeill, New York Review of Books) book, Jared Diamond convincingly argues that geographical and environmental factors shaped the modern world. Societies that had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed writing, technology, government, and organized religion—as well as nasty germs and potent weapons of war—and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures. A major advance in our understanding of human societies, &lt;i&gt;Guns, Germs, and Steel&lt;/i&gt; chronicles the way that the modern world came to be and stunningly dismantles racially based theories of human history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science, the Rhone-Poulenc Prize, and the Commonwealth Club of California's Gold Medal</description>

  <description>Human rights activist Park, who fled North Korea with her mother in 2007 at age 13 and eventually made it to South Korea two years later after a harrowing ordeal, recognized that in order to be "completely free," she had to confront the truth of her past. It is an ugly, shameful story of being sold with her mother into slave marriages by Chinese brokers, and although she at first tried to hide the painful details when blending into South Korean society, she realized how her survival story could inspire others. Moreover, her sister had also escaped earlier and had vanished into China for years, prompting the author to go public with her story in the hope of finding her sister.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Steal Like an Artist&lt;/em&gt;, Austin Kleon showed readers how to unlock their creativity by “stealing” from the community of other movers and shakers. Now, in an even more forward-thinking and necessary book, he shows how to take that critical next step on a creative journey—getting known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt; Show Your Work!&lt;/em&gt; is about why generosity trumps genius. It’s about getting &lt;em&gt;findable&lt;/em&gt;, about using the network instead of wasting time “networking.” It’s not self-promotion, it’s self-discovery—let others into your process, then let them steal from you. Filled with illustrations, quotes, stories, and examples, &lt;em&gt;Show Your Work!&lt;/em&gt; offers ten transformative rules for being open, generous, brave, productive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In chapters such as&lt;strong&gt; You Don’t Have to Be a Genius&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Share Something Small Every Day&lt;/strong&gt;; and &lt;strong&gt;Stick Around&lt;/strong&gt;, Kleon creates a user’s manual for embracing the communal nature of creativity— what he calls the “ecology of talent.” From broader life lessons about work (you can’t find your voice if you don’t use it) to the etiquette of sharing—and the dangers of oversharing—to the practicalities of Internet life (build a good domain name; give credit when credit is due), it’s an inspiring manifesto for succeeding as any kind of artist or entrepreneur in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A newer edition of this book can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34403537-mindset" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a &lt;i&gt;fixed mindset&lt;/i&gt; — those who believe that abilities are fixed — are less likely to flourish than those with a &lt;i&gt;growth mindset&lt;/i&gt; — those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love — to transform their lives and your own.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ISBN 0553213695 / 9780553213690&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was laying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With it's startling, bizarre, yet surprisingly funny first opening, Kafka begins his masterpiece, &lt;i&gt;The Metamorphosis&lt;/i&gt;. It is the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetle-like insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing—though absurdly comic—meditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, &lt;i&gt;The Metamorphosis&lt;/i&gt; has taken its place as one of the most widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction. As W.H. Auden wrote, "Kafka is important to us because his predicament is the predicament of modern man."</description>

  <description>If you want to build a better future, you must believe in secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.</description>

  <description>When Hilton was just a boy, his aged grandmother saved him from drowning by pulling him out of a treacherous ocean current, sacrificing her life for his. Now, thirty years later, Hilton begins to think his borrowed time is running out. His wife, the only elected African–American judge in Dade County, Florida, has begun receiving racist hate mail from a man she once prosecuted, and Hilton's sleep is plagued by nightmares more horrible than any he has ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he battles both the psychotic stalking of his family and the unseen enemy that haunts his sleep, Hilton's sense of reality is slipping away.</description>

  <description>Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, &lt;i&gt;A Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; a child is lost in the twilight between life and death; and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counter-plots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.</description>

  <description>This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here is the bleak new world of the day after: a world stripped of its institutions and emptied of 99 percent of its people. A world in which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides - or are chosen. A world in which good rides on the frail shoulders of the 108-year-old Mother Abagail - and the worst nightmares of evil are embodied in a man with a lethal smile and unspeakable powers: Randall Flagg, the dark man.</description>

  <description>Drawing on his own incarceration and exile, as well as on evidence from more than 200 fellow prisoners and Soviet archives, Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn reveals the entire apparatus of Soviet repression—the state within the state that ruled all-powerfully. Through truly Shakespearean portraits of its victims—men, women, and children—we encounter secret police operations, labor camps and prisons; the uprooting or extermination of whole populations, the welcome that awaited Russian soldiers who had been German prisoners of war. Yet we also witness the astounding moral courage of the incorruptible, who, defenseless, endured great brutality and degradation. &lt;i&gt;The Gulag Archipelago 1918–1956&lt;/i&gt;—a grisly indictment of a regime, fashioned here into a veritable literary miracle—has now been updated with a new introduction that includes the fall of the Soviet Union and Solzhenitsyn's move back to Russia.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Could psychedelic drugs change our worldview? One of America's most admired writers takes us on a mind-altering journey to the frontiers of human consciousness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;When LSD was first discovered in the 1940s, it seemed to researchers, scientists and doctors as if the world might be on the cusp of psychological revolution. It promised to shed light on the deep mysteries of consciousness, as well as offer relief to addicts and the mentally ill. But in the 1960s, with the vicious backlash against the counter-culture, all further research was banned. In recent years, however, work has quietly begun again on the amazing potential of LSD, psilocybin and DMT. Could these drugs in fact improve the lives of many people? Diving deep into this extraordinary world and putting himself forward as a guinea-pig, Michael Pollan has written a remarkable history of psychedelics and a compelling portrait of the new generation of scientists fascinated by the implications of these drugs. &lt;i&gt;How to Change Your Mind&lt;/i&gt; is a report from what could very well be the future of human consciousness.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217957585-hillbilly-elegy" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;ISBN 9780062300546&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hillbilly Elegy&lt;/i&gt; recounts J.D. Vance's powerful origin story...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a former marine and Yale Law School graduate now serving as a U.S. Senator from Ohio and the Republican Vice Presidential candidate for the 2024 election, an incisive account of growing up in a poor Rust Belt town that offers a broader, probing look at the struggles of America's white working class.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hillbilly Elegy&lt;/i&gt; is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis—that of white working-class Americans. The disintegration of this group, a process that has been slowly occurring now for more than forty years, has been reported with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.'s grandparents were "dirt poor and in love," and moved north from Kentucky's Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of &lt;i&gt;Hillbilly Elegy&lt;/i&gt; plays out, we learn that J.D.'s grandparents, aunt, uncle, and, most of all, his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, never fully escaping the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty, Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A deeply moving memoir, with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, &lt;i&gt;Hillbilly Elegy&lt;/i&gt; is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.</description>

  <description>Set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens. An alien civilization on the brink of destruction captures the signal and plans to invade Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, different camps start forming, planning to either welcome the superior beings and help them take over a world seen as corrupt, or to fight against the invasion.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This is the story of a man who said that he would stop the motor of the world and did. Was he a destroyer or the greatest of liberators?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did he have to fight his battle, not against his enemies, but against those who needed him most, and his hardest battle against the woman he loved? What is the world’s motor — and the motive power of every man? You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the characters in this story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tremendous in its scope, this novel presents an astounding panorama of human life — from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboy — to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destruction — to the philosopher who becomes a pirate — to the composer who gives up his career on the night of his triumph — to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroad — to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You must be prepared, when you read this novel, to check every premise at the root of your convictions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a mystery story, not about the murder — and rebirth — of man’s spirit. It is a philosophical revolution, told in the form of an action thriller of violent events, a ruthlessly brilliant plot structure and an irresistible suspense. Do you say this is impossible? Well, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; is the first of your premises to check.</description>

  <description>From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Black Swan,&lt;/i&gt; a bold new work that challenges many of our long-held beliefs about risk and reward, politics and religion, finance and personal responsibility&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In his most provocative and practical book yet, one of the foremost thinkers of our time redefines what it means to understand the world, succeed in a profession, contribute to a fair and just society, detect nonsense, and influence others. Citing examples ranging from Hammurabi to Seneca, Antaeus the Giant to Donald Trump, Nassim Nicholas Taleb shows how the willingness to accept one’s own risks is an essential attribute of heroes, saints, and flourishing people in all walks of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As always both accessible and iconoclastic, Taleb challenges long-held beliefs about the values of those who spearhead military interventions, make financial investments, and propagate religious faiths. Among his insights:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;• &lt;i&gt;For social justice, focus on symmetry and risk sharing. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;You cannot make profits and transfer the risks to others, as bankers and large corporations do. You cannot get rich without owning your own risk and paying for your own losses. Forcing skin in the game corrects this asymmetry better than thousands of laws and regulations.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;• &lt;i&gt;Ethical rules aren’t universal&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; You’re part of a group larger than you, but it’s still smaller than humanity in general.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;• &lt;i&gt;Minorities, not majorities, run the world. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The world is not run by consensus but by stubborn minorities imposing their tastes and ethics on others.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;• &lt;i&gt;You can be an intellectual yet still be an idiot&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; “Educated philistines” have been wrong on everything from Stalinism to Iraq to low-carb diets.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;• &lt;i&gt;Beware of complicated solutions (that someone was paid to find)&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; A simple barbell can build muscle better than expensive new machines.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;• &lt;i&gt;True religion is commitment, not just faith&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; How much you believe in something is manifested only by what you’re willing to risk for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The phrase “skin in the game” is one we have often heard but rarely stopped to truly dissect. It is the backbone of risk management, but it’s also an astonishingly rich worldview that, as Taleb shows in this book, applies to all aspects of our lives. As Taleb says, “The symmetry of skin in the game is a simple rule that’s necessary for fairness and justice, and the ultimate BS-buster,” and “Never trust anyone who doesn’t have skin in the game. Without it, fools and crooks will benefit, and their mistakes will never come back to haunt them.”</description>

  <description>No matter what you eat, how much you exercise, how skinny or young or wise you are, none of it matters if you're not breathing properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing more essential to our health and well-being than breathing: take air in, let it out, repeat twenty-five thousand times a day. Yet, as a species, humans have lost the ability to breathe correctly, with grave consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journalist James Nestor travels the world to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. The answers aren't found in pulmonology labs, as we might expect, but in the muddy digs of ancient burial sites, secret Soviet facilities, New Jersey choir schools, and the smoggy streets of Sao Paulo. Nestor tracks down men and women exploring the hidden science behind ancient breathing practices like Pranayama, Sudarshan Kriya, and Tummo and teams up with pulmonary tinkerers to scientifically test long-held beliefs about how we breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Modern research is showing us that making even slight adjustments to the way we inhale and exhale can jump-start athletic performance; rejuvenate internal organs; halt snoring, asthma, and autoimmune disease; and even straighten scoliotic spines. None of this should be possible, and yet it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on thousands of years of medical texts and recent cutting-edge studies in pulmonology, psychology, biochemistry, and human physiology, &lt;i&gt;Breath &lt;/i&gt;turns the conventional wisdom of what we thought we knew about our most basic biological function on its head. You will never breathe the same again.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&lt;/i&gt; is the best chronicle of drug-soaked, addle-brained, rollicking good times ever committed to the printed page. It is also the tale of a long weekend road trip that has gone down in the annals of American pop culture as one of the strangest journeys ever undertaken.</description>

  <description>An international sensation, this hilarious, feel-good novel is narrated by an oddly charming and socially challenged genetics professor on an unusual quest: to find out if he is capable of true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Tillman, professor of genetics, has never been on a second date. He is a man who can count all his friends on the fingers of one hand, whose lifelong difficulty with social rituals has convinced him that he is simply not wired for romance. So when an acquaintance informs him that he would make a “wonderful” husband, his first reaction is shock. Yet he must concede to the statistical probability that there is someone for everyone, and he embarks upon The Wife Project. In the orderly, evidence-based manner with which he approaches all things, Don sets out to find the perfect partner. She will be punctual and logical—most definitely not a barmaid, a smoker, a drinker, or a late-arriver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Rosie Jarman is all these things. She is also beguiling, fiery, intelligent—and on a quest of her own. She is looking for her biological father, a search that a certain DNA expert might be able to help her with. Don's Wife Project takes a back burner to the Father Project and an unlikely relationship blooms, forcing the scientifically minded geneticist to confront the spontaneous whirlwind that is Rosie—and the realization that love is not always what looks good on paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Rosie Project&lt;/i&gt; is a moving and hilarious novel for anyone who has ever tenaciously gone after life or love in the face of overwhelming challenges.</description>

  <description>When Jon Krakauer reached the summit of Mt. Everest in the early afternoon of May 10, 1996, he hadn't slept in fifty-seven hours and was reeling from the brain-altering effects of oxygen depletion. As he turned to begin his long, dangerous descent from 29,028 feet, twenty other climbers were still pushing doggedly toward the top. No one had noticed that the sky had begun to fill with clouds. Six hours later and 3,000 feet lower, in 70-knot winds and blinding snow, Krakauer collapsed in his tent, freezing, hallucinating from exhaustion and hypoxia, but safe. The following morning, he learned that six of his fellow climbers hadn't made it back to their camp and were desperately struggling for their lives. When the storm finally passed, five of them would be dead, and the sixth so horribly frostbitten that his right hand would have to be amputated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Into Thin Air&lt;/i&gt; is the definitive account of the deadliest season in the history of Everest by the acclaimed journalist and author of the bestseller Into the Wild. On assignment for &lt;i&gt;Outside&lt;/i&gt; Magazine to report on the growing commercialization of the mountain, Krakauer, an accomplished climber, went to the Himalayas as a client of Rob Hall, the most respected high-altitude guide in the world. A rangy, thirty-five-year-old New Zealander, Hall had summited Everest four times between 1990 and 1995 and had led thirty-nine climbers to the top. Ascending the mountain in close proximity to Hall's team was a guided expedition led by Scott Fischer, a forty-year-old American with legendary strength and drive who had climbed the peak without supplemental oxygen in 1994. But neither Hall nor Fischer survived the rogue storm that struck in May 1996.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krakauer examines what it is about Everest that has compelled so many people -- including himself -- to throw caution to the wind, ignore the concerns of loved ones, and willingly subject themselves to such risk, hardship, and expense. Written with emotional clarity and supported by his unimpeachable reporting, Krakauer's eyewitness account of what happened on the roof of the world is a singular achievement.</description>

  <description>Television has conditioned us to tolerate visually entertaining material measured out in spoonfuls of time, to the detriment of rational public discourse and reasoned public affairs. In this eloquent, persuasive book, Neil Postman alerts us to the real and present dangers of this state of affairs, and offers compelling suggestions as to how to withstand the media onslaught. Before we hand over politics, education, religion, and journalism to the show business demands of the television age, we must recognize the ways in which the media shape our lives and the ways we can, in turn, shape them to serve out highest goals.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare. If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Deep Work&lt;/i&gt;, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four "rules," for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, &lt;i&gt;Deep Work&lt;/i&gt; takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories-from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air-and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. &lt;i&gt;Deep Work&lt;/i&gt; is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Factfulness:&lt;/i&gt; The stress-reducing habit of only carrying opinions for which you have strong supporting facts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When asked simple questions about global trends—&lt;i&gt;what percentage of the world’s population live in poverty; why the world’s population is increasing; how many girls finish school&lt;/i&gt;—we systematically get the answers wrong. So wrong that a chimpanzee choosing answers at random will consistently outguess teachers, journalists, Nobel laureates, and investment bankers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Factfulness&lt;/i&gt;, Professor of International Health and global TED phenomenon Hans Rosling, together with his two long-time collaborators, Anna and Ola, offers &lt;b&gt;a radical new explanation of why this happens&lt;/b&gt;. They reveal &lt;b&gt;the ten instincts that distort our perspective&lt;/b&gt;—from our tendency to divide the world into two camps (usually some version of &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;) to the way we consume media (where fear rules) to how we perceive progress (believing that most things are getting worse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our problem is that we don’t know what we don’t know, and even our guesses are informed by unconscious and predictable biases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;It turns out that the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think.&lt;/b&gt; That doesn’t mean there aren’t real concerns. But when we worry about everything all the time instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, we can lose our ability to focus on the things that threaten us most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspiring and revelatory, filled with lively anecdotes and moving stories, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Factfulness &lt;/i&gt;is an urgent and essential book that will change the way you see the world and empower you to respond to the crises and opportunities of the future. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Combining magic, mysticism, wisdom, and wonder into an inspiring tale of self-discovery, &lt;i&gt;The Alchemist&lt;/i&gt; has become a modern classic, selling millions of copies around the world and transforming the lives of countless readers across generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far different—and far more satisfying—than he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most importantly, following our dreams.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Brave New World&lt;/i&gt; is a dystopian social science fiction novel by English author Aldous Huxley. Largely set in a futuristic World State, whose citizens are environmentally engineered into an intelligence-based social hierarchy, the novel anticipates huge scientific advancements in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, psychological manipulation and classical conditioning that are combined to make a dystopian society which is challenged by only a single individual: the story's protagonist.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bitcoin is the newest technology for money—find out how it fits in the future.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bitcoin is the digital age's novel, decentralized, and automated solution to the problem of money: accessible worldwide, controlled by nobody. Can this young upstart money challenge the global monetary order? Economist Saifedean Ammous traces the history of the technologies of money to seashells, limestones, cattle, salt, beads, metals, and government debt, explaining what gave these technologies their monetary role, what makes for sound money, and the benefits of a sound monetary regime to economic growth, innovation, culture, trade, individual freedom, and international peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The monetary and historical analysis sets the stage for understanding the mechanics of the operation of Bitcoin, the reasons for its initial success, and the role it could play in an information economy. Rather than serving as a currency and network for consumer purchases, the author argues Bitcoin is better suited as a store of value and network for settlement between large financial institutions. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin's true importance may just lie in providing a decentralized, neutral, free-market alternative to national central banks.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Full of beautiful, heart-wrenching, and hilarious stories, A Million Miles in a Thousand Years details one man's opportunity to edit his life as if he were a character in a movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years after writing his best-selling memoir, Donald Miller went into a funk and spent months sleeping in and avoiding his publisher. One story had ended, and Don was unsure how to start another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he gets rescued by two movie producers who want to make a movie based on his memoir. When they start fictionalizing Don's life for film--changing a meandering memoir into a structured narrative--the real-life Don starts a journey to edit his actual life into a better story. A Million Miles in a Thousand Years details that journey and challenges readers to reconsider what they strive for in life. It shows how to get a second chance at life the first time around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>If anyone could be considered a Russian counterpart to the infamous British double-agent Kim Philby, it was Oleg Gordievsky. The son of two KGB agents and the product of the best Soviet institutions, the savvy, sophisticated Gordievsky grew to see his nation’s communism as both criminal and philistine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He took his first posting for Russian intelligence in 1968 and eventually became the Soviet Union’s top man in London, but from 1973 on he was secretly working for MI6. For nearly a decade, as the Cold War reached its twilight, Gordievsky helped the West turn the tables on the KGB, exposing Russian spies and helping to foil countless intelligence plots, as the Soviet leadership grew increasingly paranoid at the United States’s nuclear first-strike capabilities and brought the world closer to the brink of war. Desperate to keep the circle of trust close, MI6 never revealed Gordievsky’s name to its counterparts in the CIA, which in turn grew obsessed with figuring out the identity of Britain’s obviously top-level source. Their obsession ultimately doomed Gordievsky: the CIA officer assigned to identify him was none other than Aldrich Ames, the man who would become infamous for secretly spying for the Soviets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfolding the delicious three-way gamesmanship between America, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and culminating in the gripping cinematic beat-by-beat of Gordievsky’s nail-biting escape from Moscow in 1985, Ben Macintyre has crafted an electrifying account of an international hero. Like the greatest novels of John le Carré, The Spy and the Traitor brings readers deep into a world of treachery and betrayal, where the lines bleed between the personal and the professional, and one man’s hatred of communism had the power to change the future of nations.</description>

  <description>Doing well with money isn't necessarily about what you know. It's about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Money--investing, personal finance, and business decisions--is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don't make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life's most important topics.</description>

  <description>For readers of Atul Gawande, Andrew Solomon, and Anne Lamott, a profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir by a young neurosurgeon faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis who attempts to answer the question 'What makes a life worth living?'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade's worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. &lt;i&gt;When Breath Becomes Air&lt;/i&gt; chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student "possessed," as he wrote, "by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. "I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything," he wrote. "Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'" &lt;i&gt;When Breath Becomes Air&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's Note: An alternate cover edition can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26238021.here" title="here" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In April, 1992, a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, a party of moose hunters found his decomposed body. How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of &lt;i&gt;Into the Wild&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw away the maps. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild.</description>

  <description>One of the greatest physicists of the twentieth century, Richard Feynman possessed an unquenchable thirst for adventure and an unparalleled ability to tell the stories of his life. "What Do You Care What Other People Think?" is Feynman's last literary legacy, prepared with his friend and fellow drummer, Ralph Leighton.&lt;br /&gt;Among the book's many tales we meet Feynman's first wife, Arlene, who taught him of love's irreducible mystery as she lay dying in a hospital bed while he worked nearby on the atomic bomb at Los Alamos. We are also given a fascinating narrative of the investigation of the space shuttle Challenger's explosion in 1986, and we relive the moment when Feynman revealed the disaster's cause by an elegant experiment: dropping a ring of rubber into a glass of cold water and pulling it out, misshapen.</description>

  <description>This acclaimed autobiography presents a fascinating portrait of one of the great spiritual figures of our time. With engaging candor, eloquence, and wit, Paramahansa Yogananda narrates the inspiring chronicle of his life: the experiences of his remarkable childhood, encounters with many saints and sages during his youthful search throughout India for an illumined teacher, ten years of training in the hermitage of a revered yoga master, and the thirty years that he lived and taught in America. Also recorded here are his meetings with Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Luther Burbank, the Catholic stigmatist Therese Neumann, and other celebrated spiritual personalities of East and West. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Autobiography of a Yogi&lt;/i&gt; is at once a beautifully written account of an exceptional life and a profound introduction to the ancient science of Yoga and its time-honored tradition of meditation. The author clearly explains the subtle but definite laws behind both the ordinary events of everyday life and the extraordinary events commonly termed miracles. His absorbing life story thus becomes the background for a penetrating and unforgettable look at the ultimate mysteries of human existence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considered a modern spiritual classic, the book has been translated into more than twenty languages and is widely used as a text and reference work in colleges and universities. A perennial bestseller since it was first published sixty years ago, &lt;i&gt;Autobiography of a Yogi&lt;/i&gt; has found its way into the hearts of millions of readers around the world.</description>

  <description>One of Bukowski's best, this beer-soaked, deliciously degenerate novel follows the wanderings of aspiring writer Henry Chinaski across World War II-era America. Deferred from military service, Chinaski travels from city to city, moving listlessly from one odd job to another, always needing money but never badly enough to keep a job. His day-to-day existence spirals into an endless litany of pathetic whores, sordid rooms, dreary embraces, and drunken brawls, as he makes his bitter, brilliant way from one drink to the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Bukowski's posthumous legend continues to grow. &lt;em&gt;Factotum&lt;/em&gt; is a masterfully vivid evocation of slow-paced, low-life urbanity and alcoholism, and an excellent introduction to the fictional world of Charles Bukowski.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns&lt;br /&gt;driven time and again off course, once he had plundered&lt;br /&gt;the hallowed heights of Troy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins Robert Fagles' magnificent translation of the &lt;i&gt;Odyssey&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Iliad&lt;/i&gt; is the world's greatest war epic, then the &lt;i&gt;Odyssey&lt;/i&gt; is literature's grandest evocation of everyman's journey though life. Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces, during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the myths and legends that are retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an &lt;i&gt;Odyssey&lt;/i&gt; to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb Introduction and textual commentary provide new insights and background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles' translation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an &lt;i&gt;Odyssey&lt;/i&gt; to delight both the classicist and the public at large, and to captivate a new generation of Homer's students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, presents us with Homer's best-loved and most accessible poem in a stunning new modern-verse translation.</description>

  <description>For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare - poverty, prejudice, and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through &lt;strong&gt;self-discipline&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt; mental toughness, &lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;hard work&lt;/strong&gt;, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring &lt;em&gt;Outside&lt;/em&gt; magazine to name him "&lt;strong&gt;The Fittest (Real) Man in America.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Can't Hurt Me&lt;/em&gt;, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this &lt;strong&gt;The 40% Rule&lt;/strong&gt;, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.</description>

  <description>Full of incredible characters, amazing athletic achievements, cutting-edge science, and, most of all, pure inspiration, &lt;i&gt;Born to Run&lt;/i&gt; is an epic adventure that began with one simple question: Why does my foot hurt? In search of an answer, Christopher McDougall sets off to find a tribe of the world’s greatest distance runners and learn their secrets, and in the process shows us that everything we thought we knew about running is wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isolated by the most savage terrain in North America, the reclusive Tarahumara Indians of Mexico’s deadly Copper Canyons are custodians of a lost art. For centuries they have practiced techniques that allow them to run hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an Olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it. Their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence. With the help of Caballo Blanco, a mysterious loner who lives among the tribe, the author was able not only to uncover the secrets of the Tarahumara but also to find his own inner ultra-athlete, as he trained for the challenge of a lifetime: a fifty-mile race through the heart of Tarahumara country pitting the tribe against an odd band of Americans, including a star ultramarathoner, a beautiful young surfer, and a barefoot wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a sharp wit and wild exuberance, McDougall takes us from the high-tech science labs at Harvard to the sun-baked valleys and freezing peaks across North America, where ever-growing numbers of ultrarunners are pushing their bodies to the limit, and, finally, to the climactic race in the Copper Canyons. &lt;i&gt;Born to Run&lt;/i&gt; is that rare book that will not only engage your mind but inspire your body when you realize that the secret to happiness is right at your feet, and that you, indeed all of us, were born to run.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An updated edition of the blockbuster bestselling leadership book that took America and the world by storm, two U.S. Navy SEAL officers who led the most highly decorated special operations unit of the Iraq War demonstrate how to apply powerful leadership principles from the battlefield to business and life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combat, the most intense and dynamic environment imaginable, teaches the toughest leadership lessons, with absolutely everything at stake. Jocko Willink and Leif Babin learned this reality first-hand on the most violent and dangerous battlefield in Iraq. As leaders of SEAL Team Three's Task Unit Bruiser, their mission was one many thought impossible: help U.S. forces secure Ramadi, a violent, insurgent-held city deemed "all but lost." In gripping, firsthand accounts of heroism, tragic loss, and hard-won victories, they learned that leadership--at every level--is the most important factor in whether a team succeeds or fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willink and Babin returned home from deployment and instituted SEAL leadership training to pass on their harsh lessons learned in combat to help forge the next generation of SEAL leaders. After leaving the SEAL Teams, they launched a company, Echelon Front, to teach those same leadership principles to leaders in businesses, companies, and organizations across the civilian sector. Since that time, they have trained countless leaders and worked with hundreds of companies in virtually every industry across the U.S. and internationally, teaching them how to develop their own high-performance teams and most effectively lead those teams to dominate their battlefields.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it's release in October 2015, &lt;i&gt;Extreme Ownership &lt;/i&gt;has revolutionized leadership development and set a new standard for literature on the subject. Required reading for many of the most successful organizations, it has become an integral part of the official leadership training programs for scores of business teams, military units, and first responders. Detailing the mindset and principles that enable SEAL units to accomplish the most difficult combat missions, &lt;i&gt;Extreme Ownership&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates how to apply them to any team or organization, in any leadership environment. A compelling narrative with powerful instruction and direct application, &lt;i&gt;Extreme Ownership&lt;/i&gt; challenges leaders everywhere to fulfill their ultimate purpose: lead and win.</description>

  <description>The most influential book of the past seventy-five years: a groundbreaking exploration of everything we know about what we don’t know, now with a new section called “On Robustness and Fragility.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don’t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the “impossible.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. In this revelatory book, Taleb will change the way you look at the world, and this second edition features a new philosophical and empirical essay, “On Robustness and Fragility,” which offers tools to navigate and exploit a Black Swan world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory. Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications, The Black Swan is a landmark book—itself a black swan.</description>

  <description>Based on thousands of pages from Leonardo's astonishing notebooks and new discoveries about his life and work, Walter Isaacson weaves a narrative that connects his art to his science. He shows how Leonardo's genius was based on skills we can improve in ourselves, such as passionate curiosity, careful observation, and an imagination so playful that it flirted with fantasy. He produced the two most famous paintings in history, The Last Supper and the Mona Lisa. But in his own mind, he was just as much a man of science and technology. With a passion that sometimes became obsessive, he pursued innovative studies of anatomy, fossils, birds, the heart, flying machines, botany, geology, and weaponry. His ability to stand at the crossroads of the humanities and the sciences, made iconic by his drawing of Vitruvian Man, made him history's most creative genius</description>

  <description>Walter Isaacson's worldwide bestselling biography of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The full inside story of the breathtaking rise and shocking collapse of a multibillion-dollar startup, by the prize-winning journalist who first broke the story and pursued it to the end in the face of pressure and threats from the CEO and her lawyers.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was widely seen as the female Steve Jobs: a brilliant Stanford dropout whose startup "unicorn" promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would make blood tests significantly faster and easier. Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at $9 billion, putting Holmes's worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn't work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, Holmes had been misleading investors, FDA officials, and her own employees. When Carreyrou, working at &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal,&lt;/i&gt; got a tip from a former Theranos employee and started asking questions, both Carreyrou and the &lt;i&gt;Journal&lt;/i&gt; were threatened with lawsuits. Undaunted, the newspaper ran the first of dozens of Theranos articles in late 2015. By early 2017, the company's value was zero and Holmes faced potential legal action from the government and her investors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the riveting story of the biggest corporate fraud since Enron, a disturbing cautionary tale set amid the bold promises and gold-rush frenzy of Silicon Valley.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Obstacle Is the Way&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ego Is the Enemy&lt;/i&gt;, bestselling author Ryan Holiday made ancient wisdom wildly popular with a new generation of leaders in sports, politics, and technology. In his new book, &lt;i&gt;Stillness Is the Key&lt;/i&gt;, Holiday draws on timeless Stoic and Buddhist philosophy to show why slowing down is the secret weapon for those charging ahead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All great leaders, thinkers, artists, athletes, and visionaries share one indelible quality. It enables them to conquer their tempers. To avoid distraction and discover great insights. To achieve happiness and do the right thing. Ryan Holiday calls it stillness--to be steady while the world spins around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, he outlines a path for achieving this ancient, but urgently necessary way of living. Drawing on a wide range of history's greatest thinkers, from Confucius to Seneca, Marcus Aurelius to Thich Nhat Hanh, John Stuart Mill to Nietzsche, he argues that stillness is not mere inactivity, but the doorway to self-mastery, discipline, and focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holiday also examines figures who exemplified the power of stillness: baseball player Sadaharu Oh, whose study of Zen made him the greatest home run hitter of all time; Winston Churchill, who in balancing his busy public life with time spent laying bricks and painting at his Chartwell estate managed to save the world from annihilation in the process; Fred Rogers, who taught generations of children to see what was invisible to the eye; Anne Frank, whose journaling and love of nature guided her through unimaginable adversity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than ever, people are overwhelmed. They face obstacles and egos and competition. &lt;i&gt;Stillness Is the Key &lt;/i&gt;offers a simple but inspiring antidote to the stress of 24/7 news and social media. The stillness that we all seek is the path to meaning, contentment, and excellence in a world that needs more of it than ever.</description>

  <description>After years of exploitation, neglect, and despair, the animals of Manor Farm revolt. They drive owner Mr. Jones off the land and rechristen the property Animal Farm, a utopia of equality and mutual support. But Napoleon, a young boar who assumes command after the rebellion, is hungry for power. And as the pigs consolidate control, all the good intentions of Animal Farm are crushed by a new and inevitable tyranny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Orwell’s &lt;i&gt;Animal Farm&lt;/i&gt;, the chilling allegorical satire about the working class and the gripping rhetoric of despots, illustrates just how easy the slide into oppression and totalitarianism can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revised Previously published as &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;

  <description>In the highly anticipated &lt;i&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/i&gt;, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. &lt;i&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/i&gt; will transform the way you think about thinking.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220303420-the-count-of-monte-cristo" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrown in prison for a crime he has not committed, Edmond Dantes is confined to the grim fortress of If. There he learns of a great hoard of treasure hidden on the Isle of Monte Cristo and becomes determined not only to escape but to unearth the treasure and use it to plot the destruction of the three men responsible for his incarceration. A huge popular success when it was first serialized in the 1840s, Dumas was inspired by a real-life case of wrongful imprisonment when writing his epic tale of suffering and retribution.</description>

  <description>Alternate cover for ISBN 9780345350688&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through a life of passion and struggle, Malcolm X became one of the most influential figures of the 20th Century. In this riveting account, he tells of his journey from a prison cell to Mecca, describing his transition from hoodlum to Muslim minister. Here, the man who called himself "the angriest Black man in America" relates how his conversion to true Islam helped him confront his rage and recognize the brotherhood of all mankind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An established classic of modern America, "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" was hailed by the New York Times as "Extraordinary. A brilliant, painful, important book." Still extraordinary, still important, this electrifying story has transformed Malcolm X's life into his legacy. The strength of his words, and the power of his ideas continue to resonate more than a generation after they first appeared.</description>

      <![CDATA[Malcolm X was an extremely empowering individual. I respect his willingness to commit so passionately to what he believes in. Malcolm X lived a very different life to the one I am leading, and I enjoyed reading his zealous story. From the streets to the prisons to the temples, every situation he found himself in seemed to an extreme one. <br /><br />What connected with me most strongly was the final chapter of the book, titled 1965, when Malcolm X describes that he lives each day as if he is already dead, not believing he will live long enough to see the book published. He was right. Malcolm X was assassinated later that year. It was eerie to read but gave me a true sense of the Passion he had. ]]>

  <description>Have you ever found yourself stretched too thin?&lt;br /&gt;Do you simultaneously feel overworked and underutilized?&lt;br /&gt;Are you often busy but not productive?&lt;br /&gt; Do you feel like your time is constantly being hijacked by other people’s agendas?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you answered yes to any of these, the way out is the &lt;i&gt;Way of the Essentialist&lt;/i&gt;The Way of the Essentialist isn’t about getting more done in less time. It’s about getting &lt;i&gt;only the right things&lt;/i&gt; done.  It is not  a time management strategy, or a productivity technique. It is a &lt;i&gt;systematic discipline&lt;/i&gt; for discerning what is absolutely essential, then eliminating everything that is not, so we can make the highest possible contribution towards the things that really matter.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By forcing us to apply a more selective criteria for what is Essential, the disciplined pursuit of less empowers us to reclaim control of our own choices about where to spend our precious time and energy – instead of giving others the implicit permission to choose for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentialism is not one more thing – it’s a whole new way of doing everything. A must-read for any leader, manager, or individual who wants to learn how to do less, but better, in every area of their lives, Essentialism  is a movement whose time has come.</description>

      <![CDATA[I quite enjoyed this book actually, it was an easy read. I have always been of the mindset that "less is more" so I wasn't a hard sell. <br /><br />A popular expression is to just "go with the flow", which may be fine when deciding what bar you and your friends want to attend tonight but isn't a good approach to life. With the interconnectedness of today's society, Greg argues most of us aren't really in control of how we choose to spend our time and exert or energy. <i> Essentialism </i> is about taking control of your time and energy to pursue only what is essential. This means saying no more but saying HELL YES to the essential things. I believe every so often it's important to step back, take inventory and prioritize.]]>

  <description>Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, &lt;i&gt;Nineteen Eighty-Four&lt;/i&gt; is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life—the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language—and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.</description>

  <description>Seconds before the Earth is demolished to make way for a galactic freeway, Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect, a researcher for the revised edition of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy who, for the last fifteen years, has been posing as an out-of-work actor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together this dynamic pair begin a journey through space aided by quotes from The Hitchhiker's Guide ("A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have") and a galaxy-full of fellow travelers: Zaphod Beeblebrox--the two-headed, three-armed ex-hippie and totally out-to-lunch president of the galaxy; Trillian, Zaphod's girlfriend (formally Tricia McMillan), whom Arthur tried to pick up at a cocktail party once upon a time zone; Marvin, a paranoid, brilliant, and chronically depressed robot; Veet Voojagig, a former graduate student who is obsessed with the disappearance of all the ballpoint pens he bought over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where are these pens? Why are we born? Why do we die? Why do we spend so much time between wearing digital watches? For all the answers stick your thumb to the stars. And don't forget to bring a towel!</description>

      <![CDATA[A lot of what is in this book is common sense, but I think it is valuable to have it written down. I would say that it is a good intro to real estate but would be better suited when one is in the process of acquiring property rather than as a casual read. Disclaimer: I have no real estate experience. ]]>

  <description>Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads — his real father and the father of his best friend, his "rich dad" — and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the difference between working for money and having your money work for you.</description>

  <description>Book Two in the Magnificent Dune Chronicles--the Bestselling Science Fiction Adventure of All Time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dune Messiah&lt;/i&gt; continues the story of Paul Atreides, better known--and feared--as the man christened Muad'Dib. As Emperor of the Known Universe, he possesses more power than a single man was ever meant to wield. Worshipped as a religious icon by the fanatical Fremens, Paul faces the enmity of the political houses he displaced when he assumed the throne--and a conspiracy conducted within his own sphere of influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even as House Atreides begins to crumble around him from the machinations of his enemies, the true threat to Paul comes to his lover, Chani, and the unborn heir to his family's dynasty...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Includes an introduction by Brian Herbert&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Malcolm Gladwell, host of the podcast Revisionist History and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller &lt;i&gt;Outliers&lt;/i&gt;, offers a powerful examination of our interactions with strangers -- and why they often go wrong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While tackling these questions, Malcolm Gladwell was not solely writing a book for the page. He was also producing for the ear. In the audiobook version of Talking to Strangers, you'll hear the voices of people he interviewed--scientists, criminologists, military psychologists. Court transcripts are brought to life with re-enactments. You actually hear the contentious arrest of Sandra Bland by the side of the road in Texas. As Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, and the suicide of Sylvia Plath, you hear directly from many of the players in these real-life tragedies. There's even a theme song - Janelle Monae's "Hell You Talmbout."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know. And because we don't know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world.</description>

  <description>What do you do? Tim Ferriss has trouble answering the question. Depending on when you ask this controversial Princeton University guest lecturer, he might answer: "I race motorcycles in Europe." "I ski in the Andes." "I scuba dive in Panama." "I dance tango in Buenos Aires." He has spent more than five years learning the secrets of the New Rich, a fast-growing subculture who has abandoned the "deferred-life plan" and instead mastered the new currencies-time and mobility-to create luxury lifestyles in the here and now. Whether you are an overworked employee or an entrepreneur trapped in your own business, this book is the compass for a new and revolutionary world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Tim Ferriss as he teaches you:&lt;br /&gt;- How to outsource your life to overseas virtual assistants for $5 per hour and do whatever you want?&lt;br /&gt;- How blue-chip escape artists travel the world without quitting their jobs?&lt;br /&gt;- How to eliminate 50% of your work in 48 hours using the principles of a forgotten Italian economist?&lt;br /&gt;- How to trade a long-haul career for short work bursts and freuent "mini-retirements"?&lt;br /&gt;- What the crucial difference is between absolute and relative income?&lt;br /&gt;- How to train your boss to value performance over presence, or kill your job (or company) if it's beyond repair?&lt;br /&gt;- What automated cash-flow "muses" are and how to create one in 2 to 4 weeks?&lt;br /&gt;- How to cultivate selective ignorance-and create time-with a low-information diet?&lt;br /&gt;- What the management secrets of Remote Control CEOs are?&lt;br /&gt;- How to get free housing worldwide and airfare at 50-80% off?&lt;br /&gt;- How to fill the void and create a meaningful life after removing work and the office</description>

  <description>Written in Greek by the only Roman emperor who was also a philosopher, without any intention of publication, the &lt;i&gt;Meditations&lt;/i&gt; of Marcus Aurelius offer a remarkable series of challenging spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the emperor struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe. While the &lt;i&gt;Meditations&lt;/i&gt; were composed to provide personal consolation and encouragement, Marcus Aurelius also created one of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a timeless collection that has been consulted and admired by statesmen, thinkers and readers throughout the centuries.</description>

      <![CDATA[A very unique read. Marcus Aurelius had a very clear cut image on how a life should be lived. I found it interesting to imagine him practicing many of these “techniques” at an party or bar in Ancient Greece and how it may be similar to an experience one may have today. Much of what was said by Marcus still accurately describe behaviors common today, all these centuries later. It makes me wonder even though we have completely changed our surroundings and manipulated nature to do our bidding, how much have we changed?<br /><br />Favourite Quote: At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work — as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?” So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?]]>

  <description>Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Based on his own experience and the stories of his patients, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. At the heart of his theory, known as logotherapy, is a conviction that the primary human drive is not pleasure but the pursuit of what we find meaningful. &lt;i&gt;Man's Search for Meaning&lt;/i&gt; has become one of the most influential books in America; it continues to inspire us all to find significance in the very act of living.</description>

      <![CDATA[This has been my favourite book of the year thus far! A truly impactful read. The brutality described by Viktor Frankl during his time in the concentration camps is incomprehensible. However, I feel this opens the reader up to truly appreciate Frankl's message and his belief in a meaning based life. I folded the corner of nearly every page over as there was always a thought or idea I wanted to come back to and reflect on. This is a book I would recommend should be on the top of everyone's must read.<br /><br />Favourite Quote: “Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.”]]>

  <description>What's the most effective path to success in any domain? It's not what you think. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Plenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a skill, play an instrument, or lead their field should start early, focus intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate practice as possible. If you dabble or delay, you'll never catch up to the people who got a head start. But a closer look at research on the world's top performers, from professional athletes to Nobel laureates, shows that early specialization is the exception, not the rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Epstein examined the world's most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters and scientists. He discovered that in most fields--especially those that are complex and unpredictable--generalists, not specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on one. They're also more creative, more agile, and able to make connections their more specialized peers can't see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provocative, rigorous, and engrossing, &lt;i&gt;Range&lt;/i&gt; makes a compelling case for actively cultivating inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn. Frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. The most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening their knowledge in a single area. As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive.</description>

  <description>Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's investigations of "optimal experience" have revealed that what makes an experience genuinely satisfying is a state of consciousness called flow. During flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and a total involvement with life. Csikszentmihalyi demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience teaches how, by ordering the information that enters our consciousness, we can discover true happiness, unlock our potential, and greatly improve the quality of our lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What does everyone in the modern world need to know? Renowned psychologist Jordan B. Peterson's answer to this most difficult of questions uniquely combines the hard-won truths of ancient tradition with the stunning revelations of cutting-edge scientific research.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humorous, surprising, and informative, Dr. Peterson tells us why skateboarding boys and girls must be left alone, what terrible fate awaits those who criticize too easily, and why you should always pet a cat when you meet one on the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does the nervous system of the lowly lobster have to tell us about standing up straight (with our shoulders back) and about success in life? Why did ancient Egyptians worship the capacity to pay careful attention as the highest of gods? What dreadful paths do people tread when they become resentful, arrogant, and vengeful? Dr. Peterson journeys broadly, discussing discipline, freedom, adventure, and responsibility, distilling the world's wisdom into 12 practical and profound rules for life. &lt;i&gt;12 Rules for Life&lt;/i&gt; shatters the modern commonplaces of science, faith, and human nature while transforming and ennobling the mind and spirit of its listeners.</description>

      <![CDATA[I found this to be an extremely thought provoking read. I often had to stop and contemplate the deeply philosophical ideas being discussed and relate them to ideas I was more familiar with. This was sometimes difficult as Jordan Peterson would go on extensive tangents. However, these philosophical discussions are used to emphasis ways in which Jordan Peterson feels everyone could improve their lives. I felt that many of the twelve rules revolved around the notion ‘You are solely responsible for everything in your life and are the only one who can do something about making it better’. I believe this is the most important takeaway as it is all too easy to blame unfortunate circumstances on an external force, and accepting responsibility is an important step to improving one's quality of life.<br /><br />Favourite Quote: "The successful among us delay gratification. The successful among us bargain with the future."]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In&lt;i&gt; Sapiens, &lt;/i&gt;he explored our past. In &lt;i&gt;Homo Deus, &lt;/i&gt;he looked to our future&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;Now, one of the most innovative thinkers on the planet turns to the present to make sense of today's most pressing issues.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do computers and robots change the meaning of being human? How do we deal with the epidemic of fake news? Are nations and religions still relevant? What should we teach our children?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuval Noah Harari's &lt;i&gt;21 Lessons for the 21st Century&lt;/i&gt; is a probing and visionary investigation into today's most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it, hacking becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, technological, social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare for a very different future from the world we now live in: How can we retain freedom of choice when Big Data is watching us? What will the future workforce look like, and how should we ready ourselves for it? How should we deal with the threat of terrorism? Why is liberal democracy in crisis?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harari's unique ability to make sense of where we have come from and where we are going has captured the imaginations of millions of readers. Here he invites us to consider values, meaning, and personal engagement in a world full of noise and uncertainty. When we are deluged with irrelevant information, clarity is power. Presenting complex contemporary challenges clearly and accessibly, &lt;i&gt;21 Lessons for the 21st Century&lt;/i&gt; is essential reading.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was an excellent read and one that I would highly recommend!<br /><br />Noah Yuval Harari provides a unique perspective on almost all areas of modern-day life in a very matter-of-fact way. I was particularly interested in his discussion on human consciousness and how this is the only aspect of us that computers cannot replicate. He wrapped up the book with his take on the infamous question, ‘What is the meaning of life?’. Overall this book opened me up to a new way of thinking and prompted many new thoughts of my own.<br /><br />Favourite Quote: “ If by ‘free will’ you mean the freedom to do what you desire – then yes, humans have free will. But if by ‘free will’ you mean the freedom to choose what to desire – then no, humans have no free will.”]]>

      <![CDATA[A fantastic read! This book reminded me the enjoyment a good fiction novel brings. I found this book was a very fast paced. While well written, the author did not dwell on the minutiae of unimportant details and instead continued to move the story along, always peaking the readers interest. I will definitely be reading the other Dune novels.]]>

  <description>A real-life political thriller about an American financier in the Wild East of Russia, the murder of his principled young tax attorney, and his dangerous mission to expose the Kremlin’s corruption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill Browder’s journey started on the South Side of Chicago and moved through Stanford Business School to the dog-eat-dog world of hedge fund investing in the 1990s. It continued in Moscow, where Browder made his fortune heading the largest investment fund in Russia after the Soviet Union’s collapse. But when he exposed the corrupt oligarchs who were robbing the companies in which he was investing, Vladimir Putin turned on him and, in 2005, had him expelled from Russia. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In 2007, a group of law enforcement officers raided Browder’s offices in Moscow and stole $230 million of taxes that his fund’s companies had paid to the Russian government. Browder’s attorney Sergei Magnitsky investigated the incident and uncovered a sprawling criminal enterprise. A month after Sergei testified against the officials involved, he was arrested and thrown into pre-trial detention, where he was tortured for a year. On November 16, 2009, he was led to an isolation chamber, handcuffed to a bedrail, and beaten to death by eight guards in full riot gear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Browder glimpsed the heart of darkness, and it transformed his life: he embarked on an unrelenting quest for justice in Sergei’s name, exposing the towering cover-up that leads right up to Putin. A financial caper, a crime thriller, and a political crusade, &lt;i&gt;Red Notice&lt;/i&gt; is the story of one man taking on overpowering odds to change the world.</description>

  <description>Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her "head-for-the-hills bag". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Educated&lt;/em&gt; is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A Farewell to Arms&lt;/i&gt; is the unforgettable story of an American ambulance driver on the Italian front and his passion for a beautiful English nurse. Set against the looming horrors of the battlefield - the weary, demoralized men marching in the rain during the German attack on Caporetto; the profound struggle between loyalty and desertion—this gripping, semiautobiographical work captures the harsh realities of war and the pain of lovers caught in its inexorable sweep. Ernest Hemingway famously said that he rewrote his ending to &lt;i&gt;A Farewell to Arms&lt;/i&gt; thirty-nine times to get the words right.</description>

      <![CDATA[Ernest Hemingway is a truly exceptional writer! While reading this book I found myself admiring the craftsmanship of his unique writing style. Hemingway writes in a manner that allows him to provide extensive detail while using very few words. I appreciate the simple manner in which he writes as well as the often simplistic story lines. Yet the plot and themes of his novels are highly complex and have much deeper underlying meaning. Hemingway is a true master of his craft.]]>

  <description>Colonel Chris Hadfield has spent decades training as an astronaut and has logged nearly 4000 hours in space. During this time he has broken into a Space Station with a Swiss army knife, disposed of a live snake while piloting a plane, and been temporarily blinded while clinging to the exterior of an orbiting spacecraft. The secret to Col. Hadfield's success-and survival-is an unconventional philosophy he learned at NASA: prepare for the worst-&lt;i&gt;and enjoy every moment of it&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth&lt;/i&gt;, Col. Hadfield takes readers deep into his years of training and space exploration to show how to make the impossible possible. Through eye-opening, entertaining stories filled with the adrenaline of launch, the mesmerizing wonder of spacewalks, and the measured, calm responses mandated by crises, he explains how conventional wisdom can get in the way of achievement-and happiness. His own extraordinary education in space has taught him some counterintuitive lessons: don't visualize success, do care what others think, and always sweat the small stuff. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might never be able to build a robot, pilot a spacecraft, make a music video or perform basic surgery in zero gravity like Col. Hadfield. But his vivid and refreshing insights will teach you how to &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; like an astronaut, and will change, completely, the way you view life on Earth-especially your own.</description>

      <![CDATA[Chris Hadfield provides insight into what it takes to become an astronaut and what life in space is like. I found it very interesting to read about the sacrifices Chris had to make in order to achieve what he did. Becoming an astronaut looks glamorous on the surface, but takes immense sacrifice and dedication. However, the stories Chris told of life in space made it all seem worth it. Again, it was interesting to hear about how mundane tasks on earth, such as brushing your teeth, are a big deal in space and must be well thought out. My only complaint about this book is Chris attempted to mix in some self-improvement advice and it felt forced. I would have preferred if he focused more on his journey as an astronaut.<br /><br />Favourite Quote: “When you’re the author of your own fate, you don’t want to write a tragedy.”]]>

      <![CDATA[After reading ‘Unshakeable’ I decided to read Tony Robbins extensive financial guide. This much longer (~600 pages) book goes into detail about many of the principles discussed in ‘Unshakeable’. I felt that this was a valuable read for someone such as myself just starting their financial journey. It provided a good starting point on many of the key steps for developing financial success. The path to financial success is not a get rich quick scheme, but instead a lifetime of smart financial decisions However, I did have a few contentions with the book. First I felt that the book was much too long and many parts could be skimmed over. Additionally, unrealistic numbers were often used, glorifying the amount of money people could make following these strategies (not that they are poor strategies but the numbers get peoples hopes up). And while I was able to take away many of the key overarching principles, one cannot obviously not expect to come away as an expert, or anything close to one.<br /><br />Favourite Quote: “Remember: we’re drowning in information, but we’re starving for wisdom.”]]>

  <description>No matter your goals, &lt;i&gt;Atomic Habits&lt;/i&gt; offers a proven framework for improving—every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn how to:&lt;br /&gt;- Make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);&lt;br /&gt;- Overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;&lt;br /&gt;- Design your environment to make success easier;&lt;br /&gt;- Get back on track when you fall off course;&lt;br /&gt;...and much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Atomic Habits&lt;/i&gt; will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.</description>

      <![CDATA[A book that delivers sound and practical advice. The methods James describes such as “habitat stacking” and “make it easy” are ones that I have found helpful in the past. I would recommend selecting a few new habits to implement while reading this book in order for the concepts to stick. James also touches on the role habits have in defining who you are. He emphasized that you should first decide who you want to and then define the habits necessary to get you there. I felt that this was the most compelling message of the book.<br /><br />Favourite Quote: “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. &lt;em&gt;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k&lt;/em&gt; is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, &lt;em&gt;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k&lt;/em&gt; is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.</description>

      <![CDATA[A easy and refreshing read reminding one to focus on the important things in life. Your hours are limited and sometimes, well you just have to not give a F*** about what's not important. Mark emphasis that to lead an intentional life you have to be able to say no to make time for what you value. A key takeaway for me is that what you find the most important is what you are willingly to struggle for.<br /><br />Favourite quote: “Who you are is defined by what you are willingly to struggle for”]]>

  <description>For years Ryder Carroll tried countless organizing systems, online and off, but none of them fit the way his mind worked. Out of sheer necessity, he developed a method called the Bullet Journal that helped him become consistently focused and effective. When he started sharing his system with friends who faced similar challenges, it went viral. Just a few years later, to his astonishment, Bullet Journaling is a global movement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Bullet Journal Method&lt;/i&gt; is about much more than organizing your notes and to-do lists. It's about what Carroll calls "intentional living:" weeding out distractions and focusing your time and energy in pursuit of what's truly meaningful, in both your work and your personal life. It's about spending more time with what you care about, by working on fewer things. His new book shows you how to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; • &lt;b&gt;Track the past:&lt;/b&gt; Using nothing more than a pen and paper, create a clear and comprehensive record of your thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; • &lt;b&gt;Order the present:&lt;/b&gt; Find daily calm by tackling your to-do list in a more mindful, systematic, and productive way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; • &lt;b&gt;Design the future:&lt;/b&gt; Transform your vague curiosities into meaningful goals, and then break those goals into manageable action steps that lead to big change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carroll wrote this book for frustrated list-makers, overwhelmed multitaskers, and creatives who need some structure. Whether you've used a Bullet Journal for years or have never seen one before, &lt;i&gt;The Bullet Journal Method&lt;/i&gt; will help you go from passenger to pilot of your own life.</description>

  <description>Elon Musk, the entrepreneur and innovator behind SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity, sold one of his internet companies, PayPal, for $1.5 billion. Ashlee Vance captures the full spectacle and arc of the genius's life and work, from his tumultuous upbringing in South Africa and flight to the United States to his dramatic technical innovations and entrepreneurial pursuits. Vance uses Musk's story to explore one of the pressing questions of our age: can the nation of inventors and creators who led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk is an amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy</description>

  <description>In The Paleo Manifesto: Ancient Wisdom for Lifelong Health, John Durant argues for an evolutionary – and revolutionary – approach to health. All animals, human or otherwise, thrive when they mimic key elements of life in their natural habitat. From diet to movement to sleep, this evolutionary perspective sheds light on some of our most pressing health concerns. What is causing the rise of chronic conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, and depression? Is eating red meat going to kill you? Is avoiding the sun actually the best way to avoid skin cancer?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Durant takes readers on a thrilling ride to the Paleolithic and beyond, unlocking the health secrets of our ancient ancestors. What do obese gorillas teach us about weight loss? How can Paleolithic skulls contain beautiful sets of teeth? Why is the Bible so obsessed with hygiene? What do NASA astronauts teach us about getting a good night’s sleep? And how are Silicon Valley techies hacking the human body?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Blending science and culture, anthropology and philosophy, John Durant distills the lessons from his adventures and shows how to apply them to day-to-day life, teaching people how to construct their own personal “habitat” that will enable them to thrive. The book doesn’t just address what we eat, but why we eat it; not just how to exercise, but the purpose of functional movement; not just being healthy, but leading a purposeful life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Combining the best of ancient wisdom with cutting edge science, Durant crafts a vision of health that is both fresh and futuristic.</description>

  <description>From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.” One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.</description>

  <description>Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.&lt;br /&gt;(front flap)</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller—the outrageous exploits of one of this century's greatest scientific minds and a legendary American original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Feynman, winner of the Nobel Prize in physics, thrived on outrageous adventures. Here he recounts in his inimitable voice his experience trading ideas on atomic physics with Einstein and Bohr and ideas on gambling with Nick the Greek; cracking the uncrackable safes guarding the most deeply held nuclear secrets; accompanying a ballet on his bongo drums; painting a naked female toreador. In short, here is Feynman's life in all its eccentric—a combustible mixture of high intelligence, unlimited curiosity, and raging chutzpah.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ray Dalio, one of the world’s most successful investors and entrepreneurs, shares the unconventional principles that he’s developed, refined, and used over the past forty years to create unique results in both life and business—and which any person or organization can adopt to help achieve their goals.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1975, Ray Dalio founded an investment firm, Bridgewater Associates, out of his two-bedroom apartment in New York City. Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States, according to &lt;i&gt;Fortune&lt;/i&gt; magazine. Dalio himself has been named to &lt;i&gt;Time &lt;/i&gt;magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Principles, &lt;/i&gt;Dalio shares what he’s learned over the course of his remarkable career. He argues that life, management, economics, and investing can all be systemized into rules and understood like machines. The book’s hundreds of practical lessons, which are built around his cornerstones of “radical truth” and “radical transparency,” include Dalio laying out the most effective ways for individuals and organizations to make decisions, approach challenges, and build strong teams. He also describes the innovative tools the firm uses to bring an idea meritocracy to life, such as creating “baseball cards” for all employees that distill their strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to make believability-weighted decisions. While the book brims with novel ideas for organizations and institutions, &lt;i&gt;Principles&lt;/i&gt; also offers a clear, straightforward approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply, no matter what they’re seeking to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a rare opportunity to gain proven advice unlike anything you’ll find in the conventional business press.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The time was the 1980s. The place was Wall Street. The game was called Liar’s Poker.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Lewis was fresh out of Princeton and the London School of Economics when he landed a job at Salomon Brothers, one of Wall Street’s premier investment firms. During the next three years, Lewis rose from callow trainee to bond salesman, raking in millions for the firm and cashing in on a modern-day gold rush. &lt;em&gt;Liar’s Poker&lt;/em&gt; is the culmination of those heady, frenzied years—a behind-the-scenes look at a unique and turbulent time in American business. From the frat-boy camaraderie of the forty-first-floor trading room to the killer instinct that made ambitious young men gamble everything on a high-stakes game of bluffing and deception, here is Michael Lewis’s knowing and hilarious insider’s account of an unprecedented era of greed, gluttony, and outrageous fortune. .</description>

  <description>This brilliant novel with universal resonance, set during the 1990s Siege of Sarajevo, tells the story of three people trying to survive in a city rife with the extreme fear of desperate times, and of the sorrowing cellist who plays undaunted in their midst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day a shell lands in a bread line and kills twenty-two people as the cellist watches from a window in his flat. He vows to sit in the hollow where the mortar fell and play Albinoni’s Adagio once a day for each of the twenty-two victims. The Adagio had been re-created from a fragment after the only extant score was firebombed in the Dresden Music Library, but the fact that it had been rebuilt by a different composer into something new and worthwhile gives the cellist hope. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Kenan steels himself for his weekly walk through the dangerous streets to collect water for his family on the other side of town, and Dragan, a man Kenan doesn’t know, tries to make his way towards the source of the free meal he knows is waiting. Both men are almost paralyzed with fear, uncertain when the next shot will land on the bridges or streets they must cross, unwilling to talk to their old friends of what life was once like before divisions were unleashed on their city. Then there is “Arrow,” the pseudonymous name of a gifted female sniper, who is asked to protect the cellist from a hidden shooter who is out to kill him as he plays his memorial to the victims. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this beautiful and unforgettable novel, Steven Galloway has taken an extraordinary, imaginative leap to create a story that speaks powerfully to the dignity and generosity of the human spirit under extraordinary duress.</description>

Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.&lt;br /&gt;Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is based on that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A. Anderson (2001).</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;Want to run a faster marathon? Commitment and hard work are essential but you also need to train smarter to run faster. &lt;i&gt;Advanced Marathoning&lt;/i&gt; contains all the information you'll need to run faster, peak for multiple marathons without injury, and meet your marathon goal--whether it's running a personal best, qualifying for the Boston Marathon or winning your age division.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extensive, day-to-day training schedules are targeted to your weekly mileage and length of training program (12, 18, or 24 weeks). These training schedules will have you racing at peak speed, whether you're targeting one race or several during the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more you know about why and how the plan works, the more motivated you'll be to stick with the workouts. You'll also be better able to assess your progress as you get closer to the big race. You'll learn the scientific principles behind what makes you a faster marathoner and which workouts you need to improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many factors can affect your marathon success. &lt;i&gt;Advanced Marathoning&lt;/i&gt; gives you information on everything critical to your success, including&lt;br /&gt;- which types of training are most important for success and which are a waste of time, &lt;br /&gt;- eating and drinking for top performance in training and racing, &lt;br /&gt;- which types of nonrunning training have the biggest impact on your marathon times, &lt;br /&gt;- finding the time and energy to fit training into real life, &lt;br /&gt;- tracking your progress, and&lt;br /&gt;- planning and implementing your race-day strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author Pete Pfitzinger was the top American finisher in the 1984 and 1988 Olympic Marathons. He won the 1984 Olympic Trials by outkicking former world record holder Alberto Salazar. Pfitzinger, now an exercise physiologist, won the San Francisco Marathon twice and finished third in the 1987 New York City Marathon. Co-author Scott Douglas is a well-known writer on running, a former editor of &lt;i&gt;Running Times&lt;/i&gt;, and a competitive runner. The duo, co-authors of &lt;i&gt;Road Racing for Serious Runners&lt;/i&gt; (Human Kinetics, 1999), have experience, credibility, and an ability to present scientific information in a readable manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Successful marathon running requires thorough, intelligent preparation. &lt;i&gt;Advanced Marathoning&lt;/i&gt; is the only book you'll need to move beyond the basics and meet your goals--training smarter to run faster.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys. At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”</description>

  <description>13 CDs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While in Paris on business, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone the elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum. Near the body, police have found a baffling cipher. While working to solve the enigmatic riddle, Langdon is stunned to discover it leads to a trail of clues hidden in the works of Da Vinci -- clues visible for all to see -- yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Langdon joins forces with a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, and learns the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion -- an actual secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci, among others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a breathless race through Paris, London, and beyond, Langdon and Neveu match wits with a faceless powerbroker who seems to anticipate their every move. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle in time, the Priory's ancient secret -- and an explosive historical truth -- will be lost forever.</description>

  <description>First published in 1903, &lt;i&gt;The Call of the Wild&lt;/i&gt; is regarded as Jack London's masterpiece. Based on London's experiences as a gold prospector in the Canadian wilderness and his ideas about nature and the struggle for existence, &lt;i&gt;The Call of the Wild&lt;/i&gt; is a tale about unbreakable spirit and the fight for survival in the frozen Alaskan Klondike.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lawyer's advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee's classic novel - a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with exuberant humour the irrationality of adult attitudes to race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina of one man's struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"To Kill A Mockingbird" became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film.</description>
