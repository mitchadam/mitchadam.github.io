# mitchadam.github.io

My personal website: https://mitchadam.com

## Building

To run the website locally just run the command `npm run start`

## Get Books

- `python3 -m pip install python-dotenv requests xmltodict`
- `python3 get-books.py` - this broke so first manually run curl command and then run the script to populate the html file
